DRP000571	Whole transcriptome sequencing analysis of imprinted expression in Medaka (Oryzias latipes).	Within vertebrate lineages, genomic imprinting is believed to be restricted to eutherian mammals and marsupials. However, comprehensive analysis of imprinted expression in non-mammalian vertebrates has not been done. Here we performed whole transcriptome analysis of imprinted expression in medaka (Oryzias latipes) using reciprocal crosses of inbred medaka strains, Hd-rR and Kaga.	19
DRP000627	Transcriptome analysis of Tanzanian coelacanth Latimeria chalumnae	NA	19
DRP000895	Transcriptome analyses of mammalian tissues	In mammals, more than 60% of the genome is use for transcription for mRNAs and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). At present, little is known about the concerted expression of mRNAs and antisense transcripts located in their 5â€™-flanking regions, and the comprehensive transcriptome analysis focusing on the bidirectional transcription of mRNA and pancRNA has not been performed. We do not yet know the sequence characteristics of the bidirectionally transcribed regions. Here, we perform directional RNA sequencing in order to examine whether there is a correlation between the expression of sense and antisense RNAs at the genome wide level.	19
DRP001158	RNA sequencing analysis using the intestines of adult Medaka (Oryzias latipes)	To clarify the quantitative regulation of gene expression after IR irradiation, we conducted RNA sequencing using the intestine of mature fish derived from two genetically distant inbred strains of Medaka (Oryzias latipes).	19
DRP002877	Comparative transcriptomics reveals the conserved building blocks involved in parallel evolution of ant phenotypic traits	We build 17 de novo transcriptomes and applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis to transcriptomic data from 16 ant species (two social forms of Solenopsis invicta) from three sub-families of ants. In this study, we show the existence of conserved modules of co-expressed functionally related genes that are correlated with phenotypic differentiation between queens and workers.	19
DRP003761	Greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) EST analysis	Greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili) is widely distributed in tropical and temperate waters of whole world and important aquaculture fish. For functional gene identification for biological traits and breeding amberjack by marker-assisted selection (MAS) or gene-assisted selection (GAS), we carried out comprehensive transcriptome analysis of greater amberjack using next-sequencing technology to detect SNPs in expression sequences. We mixed twelve tissues (muscle, brain, eye, heart, liver, intestine, kidney, spleen, gonad, gill, fin and bladder) extracted total RNA from these tissues, synthesized cDNA from total RNA by N6 randomized primer. Normalization was carried out by one cycle of denaturation and re-association of the cDNA.	19

ERP009696	Habitat-specific gene expression in stickleback immune tissues from four parametric lake-river population pairs	The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has repeatedly colonized and adapted to diverse freshwater habitats since the last glaciation. Among those freshwater habitats, adjacent lake and river populations harbour distinct parasite communities, a recurring ecological difference proposed to drive adaptive differentiation between lake and river stickleback ecotypes. To study the rapid adaptation of sticklebacks to lake and river habitats, we analysed gene expression profiles of 77 whole-transcriptome libraries of two immune-relevant tissues, the head kidney and the spleen, obtained from wild-caught sticklebacks of the two habitat types across multiple geographic locations. Differential expression analyses identified 189 genes showing statistically significant habitat-specific expression patterns among the three European locations. Among those genes, 15 genes are annotated with putative immune functions, and 50 have been experimentally associated with immune-responses in sticklebacks, reinforcing the hypothesis that parasites contribute to adaptive evolution of lake and river sticklebacks. Comparing expression profiles of European sticklebacks to populations in similar habitats in North America, five genes exhibited habitat-specific expression across continents.	19
ERP010463	Medaka_Reciprocal_cross_RNAseq	Medaka fish is a long standing genetic model organism from the 1930s. Uniquely amongst vertebrates Medaka fish can be routinely inbred from the wild (laboratory mice are inbred, but this does not happen as a routine process from wild individuals), leading to a large number of fully inbred wild-derived strains. As part of a broader collaboration I am part of a project to inbred over 100 wild derived strains of Medaka and use them in a similar manner to Arabidopsis and Drosophila wild derived lines. To help explore the phenotyping possibilities in this context, we have taken already established wild Medaka lines and done reciprocal F1 crosses between 3 strains, and have 4 tissues, and a number of parental tissues, giving a total of 40 samples. By doing RNA-seq on these tissues we do a number of things: (a) assess the level of allele specific expression in Medaka (b) test whether there is any imprinting (parent of origin) in fish. This is thought to not be the case, but in fact has not been well tested (not least because getting truly inbred fish is hard) (c) assess the level of random allelic activation in brain (d) assess the feasibility for RNAseq based phenotyping in Medaka, providing preliminary data for future proposals.	19
ERP010733	Medaka_F1_Expression_survey	We generated reciprocal crosses between 3 inbred strains of Medaka; HdR (the reference strain), Kaga and Cab, and sequenced a number of tissues to look at allele specific differences in expression between these F1 individuals.	19
ERP011338	The Tetraodon Nigroviridis Transcriptome During Early Development	Tetraodon embryos were obtained by in vitro fertilization of eggs and their development was observed through brightfield microscopy. The embryo development was divided into distinct stages using morphological features as described for normal development of other fish species like medaka (Oryzias latipes), zebrafish (Danio rerio), and fugu (Takifugu rubripes). Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer s protocol from eggs, whole embryo at 30% epiboly (30 epi) and whole embryo at 24 hours post fertilisation (24 hpf). The RNA samples were treated with 2U Dnase I (Qiagen) per μg RNA sample at 37°C for 10 minutes. Digested samples were then treated with 20 mg/mL proteinase K (Sigma Aldrich) at 37°C for 45 minutes. The quality and quantity of total RNA were assessed with the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and no sign of degradation was detected (RIN > 9.0). Sequencing libraries were generated from total RNA samples following the Truseq RNA protocol (Illumina). Single end reads (1 x 50 nucleotides) were obtained from 3 lanes on a Hiseq1000 using SBS v3 kits (Illumina).	19
ERP012910	Transcriptome sequencing of three tissues and ten taxa related to the house mouse Mus musculus.	We sampled brain, liver and testis from populations, subspecies and species closely related to Mus musculus, spanning approximately between 3000 years and 10 million years of divergence.	19
ERP013022	RNA-seq datasets from hippocampus samples collected from 4 week old control and PRRSV infected piglets.	Environmental insults during sensitive periods can affect hippocampal development and function, but little is known about peripheral infection, especially in humans and other animals whose brain is gyrencephalic and experiences major perinatal growth. A previously published study reported increased microglial cell activity and reduced hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in neonatal piglets infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a virus that induces interstitial pneumonia. To investigate this further, we assessed gene expression patterns in hippocampal tissue obtained from control and PRRSV infected piglets at 4 weeks of age using RNA-seq.	19
ERP013761	Post-weaning blood transcriptomic differences between Yorkshire pigs divergently selected for residual feed intake	Global gene expression profiles of peripheral blood of 35 to 42 day-old Yorkshire pigs with extremely low (more efficient) and high RFI (less efficient) values from two Iowa State University lines (the low RFI line, n = 15, and the high RFI line, n =16) that were divergently selected for RFI during the grow-finish phase were determined by Illumina RNA-seq (100 bp, paired-end) on the Hiseq2000 platform to explore the transcription biomarkers for feed efficiency in pigs.	19
ERP013913	RNA-seq of synovial membranes from a preclinical model of post-traumatic knee osteoarthritis to evaluate the effects of corticosteroid treatment	Yorkshire pigs received untreated unilateral ACL transection through a medial arthrotomy (INJ, n=6), transection with immediate injection of 20mg triamcinolone acetonide (TRI, n=6) or no surgery (CON, n=6). Synovial membranes were harvested two weeks after the injury in the lateral knee joint compartment. The whole biopsy was homogenised for RNA extraction. The objective of the experiment was to test if intraarticular corticosteroid injection mitigates injury-induced synovitis and collagen degradation after anterior cruciate ligament transection and to characterize the synovial response using the described perturbations in combination with a functional genomics approach.	19
ERP013973	RNA sequencing of the spleen / headkindey of 6 juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) individuals.	Total RNA was isolated from the head kidney/spleen of six healthy juvenile Atlantic cod. These fish originate from the Norwegian cod breeding program and were grown out in in seawater of 3. 4 % salinity at 10 ºC, 24 hour light and fed ad libitum with commercial feed at the Aquaculture Research Station (Tromsø, Norway). The fish were reported to be healthy without any history of diseases and the use of these fish was approved by the National Animal Research authority in Norway (FOTS id 1147). The tissue was stored on RNAlater (Life Technologies) and total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies) according to protocol but using half the amount of tissue per volume Trizol recommended by the manufacturer. Sequencing libraries were produced according to the IlluminaTruSeq protocol (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Illumina HiSeq2000 100 bp paired-end sequencing services were provided by the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (http://www. sequencing.uio. no).	19

ERP017705	Evidence of Late Pleistocene origin of Astyanax mexicanus cavefish	We found higher substitution rates in cavefish compared with surface fish, in accordance with a smaller cavefish population size which has allowed more rapid fixation of derived alleles present in the ancestral population. This result also implies that the Pachón cave population is much *younger* than previously estimated. The comparison of these data with simulations suggests that the Pachón cavefish population has probably been underground less than 30,000 years. This new time frame, together with other evidence, indicate that the evolution of cave phenotypes mainly involves the fixation of cryptic genetic variants present in surface fish populations within a short period of time.	19

SRP000304	Chromatin-Associated Periodicity in Genetic Variation Downstream of Transcriptional Start Sites	Might DNA sequence variation reflect germline genetic activity and underlying chromatin structure? Using two strains of medaka (Japanese killifish, Oryzias latipes), we compared genomic sequence and mapped ~37.3 million nucleosome cores from medaka Hd-rR blastulae, together with 11,654 representative transcription start sites from six embryonic stages. We observed a ~200-base pair (bp) periodic pattern of genetic variation downstream of transcription start sites; the rate of insertions and deletions longer than 1 bp peaked at positions of approximately 200, 400, and 600 bp, whereas the point mutation rate showed corresponding valleys. This ~200-bp periodicity was correlated with the chromatin structure, with nucleosome occupancy minimized at positions 0, 200, 400, and 600 bp. These data exemplify the potential for genetic activity (transcription) and chromatin structure to contribute in molding the DNA sequence on an evolutionary time scale.	19

SRP002215	Aberrant host immune response induced by highly virulent PRRSV identified by digital gene expression tag profiling	Overall design: Nine conventionally-reared, healthy 6-week-old, crossbred weaned pigs (Landrace×Yorkshire) were selected from a high-health commercial farm. All pigs were PRRSV-seronegative determined by ELISA (HerdChek PRRS 2XR; IDEXX Laboratories) and absence of PRRSV tested by RT-PCR. Pigs were randomly assigned to three groups in the experiment and raised in isolation rooms. Six pigs were inoculated with 6 ml viral suspension (4 ml intranasally and 2 ml intramuscularly) of H-PRRSV at a dose of 106.0 TCID50 ml-1 on day 0. Three negative control pigs were treated similarly with an identical volume of DMEM culture media from uninfected MARC-145 cells 1 day prior to experimental infection, and were immediately necropsied.H-PRRSV-inoculated pigs were clinically examined daily and rectal body temperatures were recorded from days -2 to 7 post infection (pi).Three infected pigs randomly chosen within each group were necropsied at each time point of 96 h pi and 168 h pi. Lung samples were collected from uninfected negative control group (C), three pigs at 96 h pi (H96), three pigs at 168 h pi (H168) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA isolation or fixed in 10% neutralized buffered formalin for histological processing. Total RNA was extracted from frozen lungs using standard protocols (Trizol) and then treated with DNase to remove potential genomic DNA contamination according to the manufactures's protocols. RNA integrity and concentration were evaluated by Agolent 2100 Bioanalyzer.For RNA library construction and deep sequencing, RNA samples were prepared as follows: for each time point of H-PRRSV-inoculated group and UNC group equal quantities of RNA isolated from three individual lungs were pooled. Approximately 6 µg of RNA representing each group were submitted to Solexa (now Illumina Inc.) for sequencing.	19

SRP002417	Genome-wide evolutionary analysis of eukaryotic DNA methylation	Eukaryotic cytosine methylation represses transposable elements, but also occurs in bodies of active genes. The extent to which these processes are conserved is unclear, and little is known about methylation outside of mammals, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Neurospora crassa. Utilizing deep bisulfite sequencing, we have quantified DNA methylation in five plant, seven animal, and five fungal genomes. We find that gene body methylation is conserved between plants and animals, whereas selective methylation of transposons has evolved independently in the vertebrate lineage. We show that methylation of plant transposons in the CHG context extends to green algae, and present evidence for RNA-directed DNA methylation of fungal genes. We also show that antagonism between DNA methylation and histone H2A.Z is conserved between plants and animals. Our data demonstrate that extant DNA methylation systems are mosaics of conserved and derived features, and indicate that gene body methylation is an ancient property of eukaryotic genomes. Keywords: Epigenetics Overall design: Examination of DNA methylation and transcription in plant, animal, and fungal genomes, and examination of how H2A.Z deposition relates to both methylation and transcription in puffer fish. Descriptions of the Samples' raw and processed data (provided as supplementary files) can be found in GSE19824_README.txt at the foot of this record.	19

SRP005402	Sequencing and characterization of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) transcriptome	Studies on the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) have advanced our general understanding of ecology and evolutionary biology but progress in that understanding has been hampered by a lack of genetic and genomic tools. Next-generation sequencing tools are providing researchers with a relatively fast and affordable option to develop genomic tools. Here we present a de novo assembly of the guppy transcriptome using 454 sequence reads. We also evaluate some of the uses of the transcriptome, including a pilot study in gene expression differences using Illumina short sequence reads.	19
SRP006208	A global view of the complexity of the porcine transcriptome using a full-sib pair with extreme phenotypes in growth and fat deposit by deep RNA sequencing (mRNA)	Pig is an important animal model for human obesity and diseases. However, the complexity of the porcine transcriptome is not yet fully elucidated. Here we have used massively parallel high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-Seq) to generate a high-resolution map of the porcine transcriptome and miRNA in liver (LI), longissimus dorsi (LD) and abdominal fat (AF) from an F2 female full-sib pair with extreme phenotypes in growth and fat deposit. On the basis of the porcine annotated genes against the UCSC database, we identified 21,414 annotated genes in our RNA-Seq analysis and 48,045-122,931 novel transcript fragments, which could be clustered into 17,085-29,499 novel transcriptional active regions (nTARs). We found that ~18.8% of the detected known genes showed alternative splicing patterns, and alternative 3' splicing was the most common type of alternative splicing events in pigs. We also detected that more than 22.7% of the known genes identified here were extended at their 5' and/or 3' end. We identified 2,796, 1,551 and 835 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively, in AF, LI and LD between the two individuals. Overall design: Examining the complexity of the pig transcriptome in three organs (liver, abdominal fat, longissimus dorsi muscle) from a female full-sib pair.	19
SRP006209	Comparative analyses of transcriptome during skeletal muscle development between pig breeds differing in muscle growth rate by deep-sequencing	Obese and lean pig show breed-specific traits in muscle growth and meat quality. However, the mechanisms underlying remains unclear. Here, we reported the first genome-wide muscle development research from embryonic to 6 months old between Lantang (obese) and Landrace (lean) using Solexa/Illumina's Genome Analyzer. We obtained 4.22±0.9×107 total reads per sample with approximately 5×106 distinct tags. Filtered adaptor tags, empty reads, low quality tags and tags of copy number =1, we obtained 3.84±0.9×107 clean total tags with 1.5±0.5×106 clean distinct tags. Overall design: 20 libraries of longissimus muscle samples were sequenced in Lantang and Landrace at days 35, 49, 63, 77, 91 prenatal and 2, 28, 90, 120, 180 postnatal days.	19

SRP008516	Sus scrofa strain: Iberian	In this study, we used high-throughput transcriptome sequencing in two pigs from extreme breeds. Our aim was to discover and characterize novel expressed transcripts and to identify differentially expressed genes that may explain some of the phenotypic variation.

SRP008998	Genes with structural flexibility in nucleosome organization and evolutionary flexibility in transcriptional initiation	Background: Transcription start sites (TSSs) with pronounced and phased nucleosome arrays downstream and nucleosome-depleted regions upstream of TSSs are observed in various species. Results: We have characterized sequence variation and expression properties of this set of TSSs (which we call "Nucleocyclic TSSs") using germline and somatic cells of three medaka (Oryzias latipes) inbred isolates from different locations. We found nucleocyclic TSSs in medaka to be associated with higher gene expression and characterized by a clear boundary in sequence composition with potentially-nucleosome-destabilizing A/T-enrichment upstream (p<1E-60 ) and nucleosome-accommodating C/G-enrichment downstream (p<1E-40 ) that was highly conserved from an ancestor. A substantial genetic distance between the strains facilitated the in-depth analysis of patterns of fixed mutations, revealing a localization-specific equilibrium between the rates of distinct mutation categories that would serve to maintain the conserved sequence anisotropy around TSSs. Downstream of nucleocyclic TSSs, C to T, T to C, and other mutation rates on the sense strand increased around first nucleosome dyads and decreased around first linkers, which contrasted with genomewide mutational patterns around nucleosomes (p<5%). C to T rates are higher than G to A rates around nucleosome associated with germline nucleocyclic TSS sites (p<5%), potentially due to the asymmetric effect of transcription-coupled repair. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate an atypical evolutionary process surrounding nucleocyclic TSSs.	19

Salmonids contribute to local and global economies through aquaculture, wild stock fisheries and recreational sport fisheries. In addition, they are a traditional food source for aboriginal peoples and play a central role in their culture. Salmon and trout are sentinel species for monitoring the aquatic environment, and therefore they are used extensively for eco-toxicology studies. Importantly, the common ancestor of salmon and trout experienced a whole genome duplication (60-100MYA), and modern species may be considered pseudo tetraploid as they are well along the process of reverting to a stable diploid state. There is a large salmonid research community working on the biology, life histories, population dynamics, biogeography, phylogenetic relationships, physiology and nutrition of salmonids. No other species group of fishes receives such comprehensive commercial and scientific attention. p An International Collaboration to Sequence the Atlantic Salmon Genome (ICSASG), representing researchers, funding agencies and industry from Canada, Chile and Norway, was formed to undertake a comprehensive genome sequence that would benefit all salmonids. p Note: Double haploid individual chosen for sequencing	19
SRP012154	Next generation sequencing reveals differentially expressed genes associated with development of PSE turkey meat.	The success of turkey breeding for rapid growth rate and larger breast size has coincided with an increasing incidence of a meat quality defect described as pale, soft and exudative (PSE). We hypothesized that this defect, which is associated with an abnormally rapid rate of postmortem metabolism, derives from altered expression of genes involved in metabolic regulation. Our objective was to use deep transcriptome RNA sequence analysis (RNAseq) to identify differentially expressed genes between normal and PSE turkey breasts. Following harvest of turkey breasts (n = 43), the pH at 15 min post-slaughter and percent marinade uptake at 24h post-slaughter were determined. Breast samples were classified as normal or PSE based on marinade uptake (high = normal; low = PSE). Total RNA from samples with the highest (n=4) and lowest (n=4) marinade uptake were isolated and sequenced using the Illumina GAIIX platform. Of 21,340 gene loci discovered by RNAseq, 8480 loci completely matched the turkey reference genome, and 480 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate, FDR<0.05) between normal and PSE samples. Two highlights were the genes nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV), upregulated about 38-fold and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4), downregulated 14-fold in PSE samples. Pathway analysis suggested that several biological functions, including carbohydrate metabolism and energy production, were affected by meat quality. Because PDK4 regulates conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, differences in regulation of oxidative metabolism may exist among turkeys. Accelerated early postmortem metabolism would result in faster pH decline in PSE meat. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that decreased expression of PDK4 was associated with lower pH in PSE samples (pH[PSE] = 5.59±0.09, pH[normal] = 5.77±0.17). The RNAseq results provided a greater molecular mechanistic understanding of development of PSE turkey, which will be a foundation for new intervention strategies to prevent development of this defect. Overall design: The mRNA profiles of normal and PSE turkey breast muscle were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx platform. Multiplexing was performed (2 samples/lane). Afterwards, difference in gene expression between normal and PSE samples were tested.	19
SRP012475	RNA-seq analysis of differential gene expression in liver from lactating dairy cows divergent in negative energy balance	Background: The liver is central to most economically important metabolic processes in cattle. However, the changes in expression of genes that drive these processes remain incompletely characterised. RNA-seq is the new gold standard for whole transcriptome analysis but so far there are no reports of its application to analysis of differential gene expression in cattle liver. We used RNA-seq to study differences in expression profiles of hepatic genes and their associated pathways in individual cattle in either mild negative energy balance (MNEB) or severe negative energy balance (SNEB). NEB is an imbalance between energy intake and energy requirements for lactation and body maintenance. This aberrant metabolic state affects high-yielding dairy cows after calving and is of considerable economic importance because of its negative impact on fertility and health in dairy herds. Analysis of changes in hepatic gene expression in SNEB animals will increase our understanding of NEB and contribute to the development of strategies to circumvent it. Results: RNA-seq analysis was carried out on total RNA from liver from early post partum Holstein Friesian cows in MNEB (n=5) and SNEB (n=6). 12,833 genes were deemed to be expressed (>4 reads per gene per animal), 413 of which were shown to be statistically significantly differentially expressed (SDE) at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1% and 200 of which were SDE (FDR of 0.1%) with a =2-fold change between MNEB and SNEB animals. GOseq/KEGG pathway analysis showed that SDE genes with =2- fold change were associated (P <0.05) with 9 KEGG pathways. Seven of these pathways were related to fatty acid metabolism and unexpectedly included â€˜Steroid hormone biosynthesisâ€™, a process which mainly occurs in the reproductive organs rather than the liver. Conclusions: RNA-seq analysis showed that the major changes at the level of transcription in the liver of SNEB cows were related to fat metabolism. ''Steroid hormone biosynthesis'', a process that normally occurs in reproductive tissue, was significantly associated with changes in gene expression in the liver of SNEB cows. Changes in gene expression were found in this pathway that have not been previously been identified in SNEB cows. Overall design: 11 liver RNA samples were analysed in total, 6 samples were from SNEB animals and 5 samples from MNEB animals	19

SRP014561	Comparative transcriptome analysis of various adipose depots in Hanwoo	*Background: Adipocytes mainly function as energy storage and endocrine cells. The amount and distribution of fat are important factor that influence the meat quality in the beef industry. Fat depot can be found around internal organ (ometal), beneath the skin (subcutaneous), and between muscles (intramuscular). Different adipose depot showed the biological and genetic difference depending on their location. This inter-depot variation might be influenced by the inherent genetic programing for development of adipose depots. In this study, we used RNA-seq data to investigate the difference in transcriptome of various adipose depots in Hanwoo. *Results: Using RNA-seq, we identified 5797, 2156, and 5455 DEGs in the comparison between OI, OS, and IS respectively (FDR<0.01) and found 853, 48, and 979 DEGs specific to subcutaneous, intramuscular and omental fat respectively. DEGs in intramuscular fat were highly enriched the metabolism related pathways compared to other fat depots. DEGs specific to the omental fat is significantly enriched in PPAR signaling pathway and cell-junction related pathway. In subcutaneous fat, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction with chemokines (CXC and CC subfamily) was the most significantly enriched the pathways. Interestingly, melanogenesis pathway was associated with the subcutaneous depot. Even though the adipose tissues shared the same pathways for adipocyte differentiation, the regulation of genes were different based on the depot. *Conclusions: We comparatively analyzed the transcripome profile from different adipose tissues using NGS and identified DEGs between adipose depot and specific to depot in Hanwoo animals. The functional annotation analysis of DEGs found that transcriptome profile difference in various adipose tissue of intramuscular, subcutaneous, and ometal fat. Overall design: whole mRNA sequencing profiles of nine Korean native cattle (nine profiles of omental fat tissue, nine profiles of intramuscular fat tissue, nine profiles of subcutaneous fat tissue and eight profiles of muscle tissue)	19

SRP018102	Deep Sequencing of the Porcine Endometrial Transcriptome on Day 14 of Pregnancy	In pigs, conceptus attachment to the uterine surface epithelium starts around day 14 of pregnancy preceded by a pronounced vascularization at the implantation zones, initiating the epitheliochorial placentation. To characterize the complex transcriptome changes in the endometrium in the course of initial conceptus attachment deep sequencing of endometrial RNA samples of pregnant animals (n=4) and corresponding cyclic controls (n=4) was performed using Illumina RNA-Seq. The obtained sequence reads were mapped to the porcine genome and relative expression values were calculated for the analysis of differential gene expression. Statistical analysis revealed 1,933 differentially expressed genes (FDR 1%), 1,229 with higher and 704 with lower mRNA concentration in the samples from pregnant animals. Expression of selected genes was validated by the use of quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The RNA-Seq data were compared to results of a microarray study of bovine endometrium on day 18 of pregnancy and additional related data sets. Bioinformatics analysis revealed for the genes with higher mRNA concentration in pregnant samples strong overrepresentation particularly for immune-related functional terms but also for apoptosis and cell adhesion. Overrepresented terms for the genes with lower mRNA concentration in pregnant samples were related to extracellular region, ion transport, cell adhesion and lipid and steroid metabolic process. In conclusion, RNA-Seq analysis revealed comprehensive transcriptome differences in porcine endometrium between day 14 of pregnancy and corresponding cyclic endometrium and highlighted new processes and pathways probably involved in regulation of non-invasive implantation in the pig. Overall design: In total, 8 samples were analyzed, 4 biological replicates for pregnant animals (samples from 4 different animals) and 4 biological replicates for cyclic controls (samples from 4 different animals)	19
SRP018524	RNA deep sequencing reveals novel candidate genes and polymorphisms in boar testis and liver tissues with divergent androstenone levels.	Boar taint described as an offensive odor that is released while cooking pork. Androstenone, a steroid mainly synthesized in testis and metabolized in liver is one of the major causes of boar taint. The aim of the present study was to investigate transcriptome differences in boar testis and liver tissues with divergent androstenone levels using RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq). For this purpose, mRNA expression from testis and liver tissue samples from 10 boars, 5 samples each for high and low androstenone levels were quantified and analyzed. The results shows that in testis samples 46 genes were differentially regulated whereas 25 genes showed differential expression in the liver. Digital gene expression analysis identified genes in keratin family, desmoplakin and Interferon-induced protein family for as candidate genes for low androstenone testis sample and genes in flavin monooxygenease family, cytochrome P450 family and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family as candidate genes for low androstenone liver sample. Additionally, the results revealed that mutations in genes IRG6, DSP, IFIT2 were specific for low androstenone testis tissues and mutations in genes FMO5, HIST1H4K and TSKU were specific for low androstenone liver samples. Overall design: Testis and liver mRNA profile of high and low androstenone level were generated by RNA deep sequencing, in five animal for each group, Ilumina HiSeq 2000	19
SRP018725	Astyanax mexicanus Transcriptome or Gene expression	Astyanax provides a model for the retinal degeneration diseases of old age. Some populations of the Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus) are blind cavefish that inhabit perpetually dark caves in Mexico. Living in environments devoid of light, Astyanax have evolved impaired vision and pigment loss by genetic drift or natural selection. Other populations of the Mexican tetra inhabit rivers and streams of northern Mexico and the southern US; these surface populations have normal eyes and dark pigment cells in their skin, thus providing a ''wild-type control'' for the ''evolutionary mutant'' cavefish. This species thus provides an ideal opportunity to study the genetic basis of retinal degeneration.	19
SRP018740	miRNA and mRNA sequencing in cattle and pig	This study aimed to elucidate the role of ruminant-specific miRNAs in shaping mRNA expression divergence between ruminant and non-ruminant species. Three cattle and three pig blood samples were used for miRNA sequencing. One pooled sample from seven cattle blood samples and three pig blood samples were used for mRNA sequencing. Peripheral whole blood (approximately 2.5 mL) was collected from the jugular vein of cattle and pigs, into PAXgene Blood RNA tubes. TruSeq mRNA and miRNA library was constructed using Illumina System (TruSeq RNA and small RNA sample Preparation Kit). Sequencing was performed on the HiScan SQ system (Illumina) using the TruSeq SBS kit v3 (50 cycels, Illumina).	19

SRP026485	RNA-seq analysis of differential gene expression in muscle from angus beef steers undergoing diet restriction and compensatory growth	The objective of this study was to examine changes in muscle gene expression of growing steers during a period of dietary energy restriction followed by a period of realimentation. Crossbred Aberdeen Angus x Holstein Friesian (n = 24) steers were assigned to one of two feeding treatments. Over a 99 d period, 1 group (n=12) was offered a high energy control diet consisting of concentrates ad libitum and 7 kg of grass silage per head daily. The second group (n=12) was offered an energy restricted diet consisting of grass silage ad libitum plus 0.5 kg of concentrate per head per day. From the end of the differential feeding period (99 d), both groups of animals were offered a total mixed ration (grass silage:concentrate ratio of 80:20). This period, which lasted 200 d, was known as the realimentation period. All animals were slaughtered on d 299 of the study. Muscle biopsies were collected at 2 time points (end of the differential feeding period (d 99) and during the realimentation period (d131). RNA was extracted and muscle gene expression was examined using RNA-seq technology and bioinformatic analysis. During the differential feeding period, 17 over-represented pathways were identified, including the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor signalling, glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis and metabolic pathways controlling the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins which indicate reduced energy intake and fat tissue accumulation occurring in muscle tissue during the restriction phase. During the realimentation period, 164 differentially expressed genes were annotated to 9 over-represented pathways including starch and sucrose metabolism, carbohydrate digestion and absorption and TGF-ÃŸ signalling pathway. It is hypothesised that the signalling effects of the TGF-ÃŸ pathway were reduced thereby promoting accelerated cell growth and proliferation in muscle tissue of animals experiencing compensatory growth. This information can be exploited in genomic breeding programmes to assist selection of cattle with a greater ability to compensate following a period dietary restriction. Overall design: 24 muscle RNA samples were analysed in total. 6 samples were from muscle biopsies collected at the end of a period of dietary restriction (d99) and 6 samples were from muscle biopsies collected at the peak of compensatory growth (d131). In addition, RNA was also analysed from 6 samples collected from animals fed ad libitum at each of these two timepoints.	19
SRP027011	In search of epigenetic marks in testes and sperm cells of differentially fed boars [RNA-Seq]	Overall design: Gene expression in sperm cells from differentially fed F0 boars was measured. F0 boars received either a standard diet or a standard diet supplemented with methylating micronutrients. These boars were used to study transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in a three generation pig pedigree. Therefore it was of interest if the diet affects gene expression in sperm cells which could then be transmitted to next generations.	19
SRP031783	Sus scrofa Transcriptome sequencing	In pigs, adipose tissue is one of the principal organs involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. It is particulary involved in the overall fatty acid synthesis with consequences in other lipid-target organs such as muscles and the liver. With this in mind, we have used massive, parallel high-throughput sequencing technologies to characterize the porcine adipose tissue transcriptome architecture in six Iberian x Landrace crossbred pigs showing extreme phenotypes for intramuscular fatty acid composition (three per group). High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to generate a whole characterization of adipose tissue (backfat) transcriptome. A total of 4,130 putative unannotated protein-coding sequences were identified in the 20% of reads which mapped in intergenic regions. Furthermore, 36% of the unmapped reads were represented by interspersed repeats, SINEs being the most abundant elements. Differential expression analyses identified 396 candidate genes among divergent animals for intramuscular fatty acid composition. Sixty-two percent of these genes (247/396) presented higher expression in the group of pigs with higher content of intramuscular SFA and MUFA, while the remaining 149 showed higher expression in the group with higher content of PUFA. Pathway analysis related these genes to biological functions and canonical pathways controlling lipid and fatty acid metabolisms. In concordance with the phenotypic classification of animals, the major metabolic pathway differentially modulated between groups was de novo lipogenesis, the group with more PUFA being the one that showed lower expression of lipogenic genes. These results will help in the identification of genetic variants at loci that affect fatty acid composition traits. The implications of these results range from the improvement of porcine meat quality traits to the application of the pig as an animal model of human metabolic diseases.	19

We characterized transcriptomic variation across multiple tissues and developmental stages and between individuals in 59 vervet monkeys from the Vervet Research Colony extended pedigree. We conducted RNA sequencing across early (7, 90 days, and one year) and later (1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, and 4+ years old) developmental time points in 6 individuals at each stage in five tissue types: two brain tissues from hippocampus and caudate, two endocrine tissues (pituitary and adrenal) and two peripheral tissues serving as a source of biomarkers (blood and fibroblasts)	19

SRP035333	pig adipose Transcriptome with extreme backfat thickness	The traits of fatness were important for the growth, meat quality, reproductive performance and immune. The regulation of lipid metabolism takes place in the two principal organs as adipose tissue and liver. In this study, we have used massive parallel high-throughput sequencing technologies to the porcine adipose tissue and liver tissue transcriptome architecture in six songliao black pigs showing extreme phenotypes for backfat thickness of live (three per group, two pairs full-sibs). The total number of reads produced for each sample ranged about 26 million. Approximately 188 were differentially regulated in adipose tissue. Differentially regulated genes in adipose samples were enriched in metabolic processes such as fatty acid biosynthesis, lipid synthesis, metabolisms of fatty acid metabolic, etinol, caffeine, arachidonic acid, drug and immune. Further studies are required for proving the role of candidate genes to be used in genomic selection for fat deposition in pig breeding programs.	19

SRP035408	Transcriptomic analysis of Rongchang pig brains and livers	Recent developments in high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology have had a dramatic impact on our comprehension of the structure and expression profiles of the mammalian transcriptome. This study performed transcriptome analysis of Rongchang pig brains and livers using deep RNA-seq technology to offer insights into potential swine genetic improvements, in addition to examining the use of the Rongchang pig as a biomedical model.By sequencing the mRNA of two extreme tissues, brains and livers, a total of 8.6 Gb of sequencing was obtained, with 91% resulting in clean reads, with approximately 43 million reads from the brain and 44 million reads from the liver samples. This analysis revealed tissue specificity through the identification of 5,575 and 4,600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in brains and livers respectively. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes showed that the top ten functional pathways with highly enriched gene expression in brains were associated with nerves, while in livers the pathways were predominantly related to metabolism. Furthermore, 83 neuropeptide gene transcripts, 69 neuropeptide receptor gene transcripts, 10 pro-neuropeptide convertase gene transcripts, 12 insulin-like growth factors binding protein gene transcripts, and other neuropeptide related protein gene transcripts were identified, to reveal different expression profiles in brain and liver samples. In this study, major characteristics of the transcriptional profiles of Rongchang pig brains and livers were present. Overall, our data provides useful information for future research pertaining to swine livestock and biomedical research. Overall design: Transcriptional profiles of Rongchang pig brains and livers were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina Hiseq 2000.	19

SRP040114	Esox lucius isolate:CL-BC-CA-002 Genome sequencing	The pike (Esox lucius) is a northern hemisphere, circumpolar, fresh water species that is typically the top predator in many lakes. It is an important northern recreational fishery. Pike are morphologically diverse and highly adaptable. Despite their wide distribution, pike populations have low levels of polymorphism and divergence, indicative of a recent common ancestor. Pike often function as sentinel species to monitor pollutants in northern waters. Mitochondrial studies have shown that Escosiformes is the closest living order to Salmoniformes. Esociformes, an old lineage with fossils dating back to 70MYA, contains 10 species (pike, muskellunge and mudminnows) of which most literature concerns pike. The genome size for pike is 1.1pg and its karyotype is 2N=50 NF=50, similar to ancestral karyotypes of many teleosts (2N=48-50, FN=48-50). This compares to the much larger Atlantic salmon karyotype of 2N=56-60, NF=74 and genome size =3.1pg. Recent studies are consistent with the pike having a pre-WGD genome and being much closer to salmon than other fish species (zebrafish, medaka, fugu or stickleback).	19

SRP040683	Transposable element targeting by piRNAs in Laurasiatherians with distinct TE activities	Transposable elements (TEs) are self-mobilizing elements that make up a large fraction of mammalian genomes. PIWI proteins and PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a part of a system aimed at controlling and preventing TE proliferation. We examined the TE landscape and piRNA repertoires from three non-model Laurasiatherian mammals (dog, horse and big brown bat) with differing TE complements and proliferation patterns to address questions about the evolutionary relationships between piRNAs and TEs. We found that the genomic abundance of new TEs may not match TE transcription. We speculate that a higher rate of SINE targeting by piRNAs in the horse genome contributed to the reduced SINE insertion rate. Overall design: Two testicular tissue sample from three taxa. Six samples total	19

SRP041650	Analysis of allele specific expression in artificial triploid medaka fish.	In general humans have two copies of each gene. These copies may not be identical, and each version is called an allele. In some disease states such as cancer, cells may contain extra genetic material such that more than two copies of some genes are present. In this project, we produced triploid fish from genetically disparate strains of medaka (Oryzias sp.) as a model and developed a computational method to distinguish the expression levels of each allele present. This project can potentially improve the ability of researchers to study polyploid organisms (for example many crop plants) and disease states (such as some cancers).	19

SRP045680	Astyanax mexicanus - Developmental Gene Expression	Astyanax mexicanus, commonly know as the blind Mexican cavefish, is an excellent system to investigate the genetic basis for traits evolving as a consequence of natural environmental pressures. This species includes multiple cave-dwelling populations that have colonized the dark, subterranean environment, and repeatedly evolved a suite of troglomorphic traits, including eye degeneration, loss of pigmentation, alterations in behavior, increased number of taste buds, and an enhanced lateral line system. To investigate the genetic changes associated with cave colonization, we have utilized RNA-seq technologies to compare gene expression variation between surface- and cave-dwelling forms of Astyanax mexicanus. This approach includes a dynamic comparison across four critical stages of early development wherein many troglomorphic-specific traits appear. These analyses dramatically enhance our understanding of phenotypic evolution in the wild, and offer insight to analogous human diseases, including retinal degeneration, pigmentation disorders, craniofacial abnormalities and altered sleep/activity patterns.	19

SRP049250	Hepatic transcriptome changes in testosterone-deficient pigs fed a high-fat diet	To gain insight into the role of testosterone in modulating hepatic fat accumulation, we collected liver tissues from high fat diet-fed intact male pigs, castrated male pigs, and castrated male pigs with testosterone replacement. RNA-Seq was employed to profile hepatic gene expression in pigs with different testosterone levels. Overall design: Liver mRNA profiles of intact male pigs fed a HFC diet, castrated male pigs fed a HFC diet, and castrated male pigs treated with testosterone fed a HFC diet were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.	19
SRP049254	Transcriptomic characterization of transcription activator-like effector nucleases-induced XY dmy- sex reversal female medaka (Oryzias latipes)	We assembled transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) targeting the DMY gene and generated XYdmy- mutants to investigate gonadal dysgenesis in medaka. RNA-seq generated 157 million raw reads from WT male (WT_M_TE), WT female (WT_F_OV) and XYdmy- female medaka (TA_F_OV) gonad libraries. Differential expression analysis identified 144 up- and 293 downregulated genes in TA_F_OV compared to WT_F_OV, 387 up- and 338 downregulated genes in TA_F_OV compared to WT_M_TE. Overall design: mRNA profiles of 90-day old wild type (WT) and TALENs induced XY dmy- sex reversal female (TA) medaka were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeqTM 2000.	19

SRP050607	RNA-seq analysis reveals significant transcriptome changes in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) suffering severe enteromyxosis	Background: Enteromyxosis caused by the intestinal myxozoan parasite Enteromyxum scophthalmi is a serious threat for turbot (Scophthalmus maximus, L.) aquaculture, causing severe catarrhal enteritis leading to a cachectic syndrome, with no therapeutic options available. There are still many aspects of host-parasite interaction and disease pathogenesis that are yet to be elucidated, and to date, no analysis of the transcriptomic changes induced by E. scophthalmi in turbot organs has been conducted. In this study, RNA-seq technology was applied to head kidney, spleen and pyloric caeca of severely infected turbot with the aim of furthering our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms and turbot immune response against enteromyxosis. Results: A huge amount of information was generated with more than 23,000 identified genes in the three organs, amongst which 4,762 were differently expressed (DE) between infected and control fish. Associate gene functions were studied based on gene ontology terms and available literature, and the most interesting DE genes were classified into five categories: 1) immune and defence response; 2) apoptosis and cell proliferation; 3) iron metabolism and erythropoiesis; 4) cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix and 5) metabolism and digestive function. The analysis of down-regulated genes of the first category revealed evidences of a connexion failure between innate and adaptive immune response, especially represented by a high number of DE interferon-related genes in the three organs. Furthermore, we found an intense activation of local immune response at intestinal level that appeared exacerbated, whereas in kidney and spleen genes involved in adaptive immune response were mainly down-regulated. The apoptotic machinery was only clearly activated in pyloric caeca, while kidney and spleen showed a marked depression of genes related to erythropoiesis, probably related to disorders in iron homeostasis. The genetic signature of the causes and consequences of cachexia was also demonstrated by the down-regulation of the genes encoding structural proteins and those involved in the digestive metabolism. Conclusions: This transcriptomic study has enabled us to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of enteromyxosis and identify a large number of DE target genes that bring us closer to the development of strategies designed to effectively combat this pathogen. Overall design: Four samples per organ (kidney, spleen and pyloric caeca) were sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000 as 100bp paired-end reads. For each organ, three samples were taken from Enteromyxum severely infected turbot and the remaining one was a pool of three control turbot.	19

SRP052656	Comprehensive identification of sexually dimorphic genes using RNA-seq with several tissues of cattle	Sexual dimorphism is one of the important topic in mammal species because appearance of males and females is obvious different in all mammal species. In addition to this, molecular mechanisms also very different each other. Furthermore, it is important to employ a variety of tissues in RNA-seq experiment because recent studies imply gene expression pattern are highly tissue specific. Although previous related studies discovered numerous sexually dimorphic mechanism in mammal species, but still, many mechanisms are undiscovered in case of non-model organisms. One of the representative mammal organism is a cattle which is less researched about sexual dimorphism. For investigate bovine sexual dimorphism, we generated two-way factorial designed 40 samples RNA-seq data composed with two factors such as gender and tissues. Two statistical approaches are employed for identifying bovine sexually dimorphic genes using such two-way factorial designed RNA-seq data. As a result, we observed that detected sexually dimorphic genes exhibited strong tissue specific pattern, but fat tissue showed relatively small tissue specificity than the others. In addition, we observed that sex-related genes are shared in two mammal species such as cattle and rat through qRT-PCR experiments. Finally, we investigated pros and cons of two statistical approaches for complex structured RNA-seq analysis. Overall design: In this study, we aimed to identify genetic factors that contribute to sexual dimorphism in bovine metabolism. To achieve this goal, we have employed RNA-seq for elaborated estimation of gene expression in liver, muscle, visceral adipose tissue and pituitary gland.	19

SRP055497	Systematic identification of long noncoding RNAs related to cattle muscle development	Long noncoding RNAs are of crucial importance in diverse biological processes such as cell-cycle regulation, genomic imprinting, and cell differentiation. However, limit studies on the overall expression status of lncRNAs during muscle development have been conducted. To explore the potential functions of lncRNAs in cattle muscle development, we employed Ribo-Zero-Seq to systematically identify lncRNAs expressed in embryonic (90 day), neonatal (3-day-old) and adult (24-month-old) longissimus muscle (LM) of Qinchuan steers. We finally defined 7692 high-confidence lncRNAs. Further data analyses showed that a total of 401 lncRNAs were differentially expressed among three tested samples, including H19, linc-MD1 and TCONS_00154844. Interestingly, the chromosomal location of linc-MD1 and TCONS_00154844 is overlapped with miR-206/miR-133b or miR-1-2/miR-133a-2 cluster, respectively. miR-1, miR-133 and miR-206 are the most extensively studied miRNAs involved in myogenesis. The genomic close positional relationship between linc-MD1 and miR-206/miR-133b, TCONS_00154844 and miR-1-2/miR-133a-2 strongly indicated that these lncRNAs may play crucial roles in muscle development. GO annotation and KEGG analyses demonstrated that the lncRNAs-targeted mRNAs were related to myogenic differentiation, including metabolic pathways, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Our findings complement the reference genome annotation of cattle, which might further aid the lncRNAs cloning and biological functional analyses.	19
SRP056008	RNA-seq of the killifish N.furzeri during normal aging (cross-sectional and longitudinal study) and treatment with rotenone	The study consists of three parts: 1) normal aging in liver and skin (cross-sectional); 2) treatment with rotenone in brain, liver and skin; 3) longitudinal study of 45 fish with different ages at their death measured at two different time points by fin clipping Jena Centre for Systems Biology of Ageing - JenAge (www.jenage.de) Overall design: 185 samples: 1) 50 normal aging samples: 2 tissues (liver and skin) * 5 age groups (5,12,20,27,39 weeks) * 5 replicates; 2) 45 samples: 3 tissues (brain, liver and skin) * 2 age groups (9,27 weeks) for controls and 1 age group for treatment group * 5 replicates; 3) 90 samples: 45 fish, each measured at 10 and 20 weeks (fin clipping)	19
SRP056073	Gadus morhua Transcriptome or Gene expression	RNASeq samples of several developmental stages of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) larvae, that were fed either a standard commercial diet of rotifers or a natural zooplankton diet that consisted primarily of copepods from first feeding.	19
SRP056278	Transcriptomic profiling of spleen in grass-fed and grain-fed Angus cattle	The grass-fed cattle obtain nutrients directly from pastures containing limited assimilable energy but abundant amount of fiber; by contrast, grain-fed steers receive a diet that is comprised mainly of grains and serves as an efficient source of high-digestible energy. Besides energy, these two types of diet differ in a large number of nutritional components. Additionally, animals maintained on rich-energy regimen are more likely to develop metabolic disorders and infectious diseases than pasture raised individuals. Thus, we hypothesize that spleenâ€“the main immune organâ€“may function differently under disparate regimes. The objective of this study was to find the differentially expressed genes in the spleen of grass-fed and grain-fed steers, and furtherly explore the potential involved biopathways. Through RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), we detected 123 differentially expressed genes. Based on these genes, we performed an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and identified 9 significant molecular networks and 13 enriched biological pathways. Two of the pathways, Nur77 signaling in T lymphocytes and calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis which are immune related, contain a pair of genes HLA-DRA and NR4A1 with dramatically altered expression level. Collectively, our results provided valuable insights into understanding the molecular mechanism of spleen under varied feeding regimens. Overall design: We collected spleen samples from two randomly chosen animals per group, totaling four samples. The animals were born and raised at the Wye Angus farm, which has produced genetically similar progenies. The genetic resemblance among individuals permitted us to better control the variation between experimental individuals, constituting an excellent resource to perform scientific research. All animals included in this study received the same diet until weaning. Next, we assigned the animals to one certain diet at random, and exclusively raised them under that regimen until termination. The diet of grain-fed group consisted of soybean, shelled corn, corn silage and trace minerals. The grass-fed steers normally received alfalfa harvested from land without any fertilizers, pesticides or other chemicals; during wintertime, bailage was supplied. Grass-fed individuals ate no animal, agricultural or industrial byproducts and never consumed any type of grain. Grain-fed animals reached the market weight around 14 month-old; however, grass-fed steers needed approximately 200 additional days to achieve the same weight. Immediately after termination at the Old Line Custom Meat Company (Baltimore, MD), a small piece of spleen was incised, washed and frozen at -80Â°C for posterior processing.	19
SRP056358	Transcriptome analysis of rectal tissues of E. coli O157 super-shedding and E. coli O157 negative cattle	Total RNA from rectal tissues of E. coli O157 super-shedders and non-shedders were sequenced using Illumina Hiseq 2000 system. For comparative analysis, differentially expressed genes were identified with edgeR. Fifteen of differentially expressed genes were related to innate and adaptive immune functions and were down-regulated in super-shedders, which could be one of reasons for super-shedding phenomenon. Overall design: We performed a differential analysis of transcriptomes of rectal tissues collected from E. coli O157 super-shedders and non-shedders, to study molecular mechanisms of super-shedding phenomenon.	19

SRP057957	Comparative anterior pituitary miRNA and mRNA expression profiles of Bama minipigs and Landrace pigs reveal potential molecular network involved in animal postnatal growth [mRNA-Seq]	The anterior pituitary is the most important endocrine organ modulating animal postnatal growth, mainly by controlling growth hormone (GH) gene transcription, synthesis, and secretion. As an ideal model for animal postnatal growth studies, the Bama minipig is characterized as having a lower growth performance and fewer individual differences compared with larger pig breeds. In this study, anterior pituitaries from Bama minipig and Landrace pig were used for miRNA and mRNA expression profile analysis using miRNA microarrays and mRNA-seq. Consequently, a total of 222 miRNAs and 12,909 transcripts were detected, and both miRNAs and mRNAs in the two breeds showed high correlation (r > 0.97). Additionally, 41 differentially expressed miRNAs and 2,254 transcripts were identified. Pathways analysis indicated that 32 pathways significantly differed in the two breeds. Importantly, two GH-regulation-signalling pathways, cAMP and inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate (IP3), and multiple GH-secretion-related transcripts were significantly down-regulated in Bama minipigs. Moreover, target prediction by two algorithms (TargetScan and RNAhybrid) indicated that most miRNA–mRNA target pairs (63.68–71.33%) presented a negatively correlated expression pattern. A possible network among miRNAs, mRNAs, and GH-regulation pathways was also proposed. These data will be helpful in understanding the possible molecular mechanisms involved in animal postnatal growth. Overall design: mRNA profiling in the anterior pituitary from two different pig breeds.2 pooled samples were analyzed. A pool of 3 pig anterior pituitary was used for Bama minpigs(YB) and Landrace pigs(YC),respectively.	19

SRP058415	Genetic variation contribute to different susceptibility to HP-PRRSV infection across pig breeds	Purpose: To characterize the differential mRNA expression profiles of lung tissues upon PRRSV infection in different pig breeds, using NGS techonology, we sequenced mRNAs of the lungs of Tongcheng and Landrace pigs before (0 dpi) and after (3, 5, 7 dpi) infection with high-pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV). Methods: The mRNA expression profiles of the lungs of Tongcheng and Landrace pigs before (0 dpi) and after (3, 5, 7 dpi) HP-PRRSV infection were produced by using solexa platform. The raw reads with low qualities were filtered and the clean high quality reads were mapped to Ensembl Sus reference genome 10.2.71 using BOWTIE2. The unique mapped reads were retained for mRNA expression analysis. The raw reads counts of each mRNA were calculated by HTseq and the differentially expressed mRNA (Fold change >2; FDR <0.05) were called using DEGseq. Overall design: Comparasion of the mRNA expression profiles of lungs from two pig breeds: Tongcheng and Landrace, at 0, 3, 5, 7 dpi infected with HP-PRRSV.	19

SRP059849	Integrated metabolomic and transcriptome analyses reveal finishing forage affects metabolic pathways related to beef quality and animal welfare	Beef represents a major diet component and source of protein in many countries. With an increment demand for beef, the industry is currently undergoing changes towards natural produced beef. Consumers not only concern about product quality, but also for the well-being of animals. Therefore, the consumption of grass-fed meat is continuously growing. However, the nutritional true differences between feeding systems are still unclear. The aim of this study was to examine latissimus dorsi muscle quality and animal welfare by transcriptome and metabolome profiles, and to identify biological pathways related to the differences between grass- and grain-fed Angus steers. By RNA-Seq analysis of latissimus dorsi muscle, we have recognized 241 differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.1). The metabolome examination of muscle and blood revealed 163 and 179 altered compounds in each tissue (P-value < 0.05), respectively. Accordingly, alterations in glucose metabolism, divergences in free fatty acids and carnitine conjugated lipid levels, and altered ÃŸ-oxidation, have been observed. In summary, this study demonstrates a unique transcriptomic and metabolic signature in the muscle of grain and grass finished cattle. Results support the accumulation of anti-inflammatory n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in grass finished cattle, while higher levels of n6 PUFAs in grain finished animals may promote inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, grass-fed animals produce tender beef with lower total fat and higher omega3/omega6 ratio than grain fed animals, which could potentially benefit consumer health. Finally, blood cortisol levels strongly indicate that grass fed animals experience less stress than the grass fed individuals Overall design: The steers came from a closed Wye Angus herd with very similar genetics. The grass-fed group was comprised of steers that received alfalfa and orchard grass hay, clover and orchard grass pasture, or orchard grass and alfalfa pasture. The grass-fed individuals consumed grazed alfalfa upon availability and bales during winter and were not exposed to any corn, any form of grain or feed by-products. The alfalfa and grass hay were harvested from land that has had minimal fertilizer and no application of pesticides or inorganic chemicals. The control group was fed a conventional diet consisting of corn silage, soybean, shelled corn and minerals. The pastures were managed as organic landsâ€“without fertilizers, pesticides or any chemical additives. At the slaughter plant, 10 ml whole blood sample from the jugular vein was collected in EDTA tubes and directly storage at -80Â°C. Then, a small piece of longissimus dorsi muscle was obtained from each hot carcass at the level of the 12th intercostal space and immediately frozen in dry ice for posterior analysis.	19
SRP060389	Sus scrofa in vitro and in vivo matured oocyte transcriptomes	The ability to mature oocytes in vitro provides a tool for creating embryos by parthenogenesis, fertilization and cloning. Unfortunately the quality of oocytes matured in vitro falls behind that of in vivo matured oocytes. To address this difference transcriptional profiling by deep sequencing was conducted on pig oocytes that were either matured in vitro or in vivo. Alignment of over 18 million reads identified 1,316 transcripts that were differentially represented. One pathway that was overrepresented in the oocytes matured in vitro was for Wingless-type MMTV integration site (WNT) signaling. In an attempt to inhibit the WNT pathway Dickkopf-related protein 1 was added to the in vitro maturation medium. Addition of Dickkopf-related protein 1 improved the percentage of oocytes that matured to the metaphase II stage, increased the number of nuclei in the resulting blastocyst stage embryos, and in oocytes reduced the amount of disheveled segment polarity protein 1 protein. It is concluded that transcriptional profiling is a powerful method for detecting differences between in vitro and in vivo matured oocytes, and that the WNT signaling pathway is important for proper oocyte maturation.	19

SRP061388	Bos taurus breed:Holstein Transcriptome or Gene expression	Johneâ€™s disease is a chronic infection of the intestinal mucosa caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP). The events of pathogen survival, inflammation and progression to the clinical stages of infection are poorly understood. This study examines gene expression in the ileoceocal valve (ICV) of Holstein dairy cows at different stages of MAP infection. The ICV is known to be a primary site of MAP colonization and provides an ideal location to identify genes that are relevant to the progression of this disease. RNA was prepared from ICV tissues and RNA-Seq was used to compare gene transcription between clinical, subclinical, and negative control animals.	19
SRP061418	Genome-wide analysis of the transcriptional response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection at the maternal/fetal interface and in the fetus	Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) infection of 3rd trimester pregnant pigs can result in transmission of the virus to the fetus and ultimately death in utero or postnatally. Little is known about the immune response to infection at the maternal-fetal interface and in the fetus itself, or the molecular events behind virus transmission and disease progression in the fetus. To investigate these processes, RNA-sequencing of two tissues, uterine endothelium adjacent to the umbilical attachment site and fetal thymus, was performed 21 days post challenge on four groups of fetuses selected from a large PRRSV challenge experiment of pregnant gilts. Overall design: RNA-seq experiment compared gene expression between four different groups of fetuses (n=12 per group): control (CON-uninfected fetuses from mock inoculated gilts), UNINF (uninfected fetuses from PRRSV-inoculated gilts), INF (infected fetuses from PRRSV-inoculated gilts), and meconium-stained fetuses (MEC-meconium-stained fetuses from PRRSV-inoculated gilts) and investigated two tissues: uterine endometrium (with adherent placental tissue) at the site of umbilical attachment and fetal thymus (96 samples in total). Three contrasts were performed for the differential expression (edgeR) and network (WGCNA) analyses: UNINF v CON, INF v UNINF, and MEC v INF.	19
SRP061933	Stickleback embryos use ABC transporters as a buffer against exposure to maternally derived cortisol	Purpose: Offspring from females that experience stressful conditions during reproduction often exhibit altered phenotypes and many of these effects are thought to arise due to increased exposure to maternal glucocorticoids. Here we used RNAseq to test whether the embryonic transcriptional response to increased levels of cortisol was similar to the transcriptional response to maternal stress in sticklebacks Methods: Eggs were treated by immersing eggs for 30 mins in water that contained 0, 5, or 10 ug/L, which represented baseline, predator induced, and super physiological levels of maternally derived cortisol. To isolated enough RNA for RNAseq, 10 embyros from each clutch/treatment were pooled prior to RNA extraction for a total of 18 pools (6 clutches x 3 treatments). Results: Analysis of genome-wide transcriptional profiles suggests that 17251 (genes which survived a cut-off of having cpm more than 1 in at least two samples; and had a significant likelihood ratio calculated in edgeR) genes out of the possible 22,456 genes in the stickleback genome were expressed in 72-hour embryos. However, we did not detect any differences in gene expression between embryos that were treated with cortisol compared to the control group. Overall design: mRNA profiles of egg clutches treated with 0, 5, or 10 ug/L are compared, which represented baseline, predator induced, and super physiological levels of maternally derived cortisol.	19
SRP062160	Spatio-temporal regulation of circular RNA expression during porcine embryonic brain development	Here we profile the expression of circRNA in 6 different brain tissues at up to 6 different time-points during fetal porcine development, constituting the first report of circRNA in a large animal. An unbiased analysis reveals a highly complex regulation pattern of thousands of circular RNAs, with a distinct spatio-temporal expression profile. The amount and complexity of the circRNA expression was most pronounced in cortex day 60 from gestation. Here we find 4,634 unique circRNAs expressed from 2,195 genes out of a total of 13,854 expressed genes. These data demonstrate that circRNAs are highly abundant and dynamically expressed in a spatio-temporally manner in porcine fetal brain, suggesting important functions during mammalian brain development. Overall design: Sequencing of rRNA depleted total RNA from 14 embryonic porcine brain samples, no replicates were done	19
SRP062497	Effect of a diet enriched with omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids on the pig liver transcriptome	The optimal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is important for keeping homeostasis of biological processes and metabolism, yet the underlying biological mechanism is poorly understood. The objective of this study was to identify changes in the pig liver transcriptome induced by a diet enriched with omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, and to characterize the biological mechanisms related to PUFA metabolism. Polish Landrace pigs (n =12) were fed diet enriched with linoleic acid (LA, omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, omega-3 family) or standard diet as a control. The fatty acids profiling was assayed in order to verify how feeding influenced the fatty acids content in liver, and subsequently next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) between transcriptomes between dietary groups. The biological mechanisms and pathway interaction networks were identified by analysis in DAVID and Cytoscape tools. Fatty acids profile analysis indicated a higher contribution of PUFAs in liver for LA and ALA-enriched diet group, particularly for the omega-3 fatty acids family, but not omega-6. Next-generation sequencing identified 3,565 DEG, 1,484 of which were induced and 2,081 were suppressed by PUFA supplemenation. Low ratio of omega-6/-3 fatty acids resulted in modulation of fatty acids metabolism pathways and over-representation of genes involved in membrane composition, signal transduction and immune response pathways. In conclusion, a diet enriched with omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids altered the transcriptomic profile of the pig liver and affected a set of genes involved in metabolic pathways important to animal health status. Overall design: Hepatic mRNA profiles of Polish Landrace pig breed fed two different diets, were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina MiSeq. Experimental diet was enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-6 and omega-3), while standard diet remain as a cotrol. 2 pooled samples each containing RNA extracts from 6 individuals livers were analyzed.	19

SRP064314	Biceps femoris muscle transcriptome in pure and crossbred Iberian pigs at birth	Iberian ham production includes both purebred (IB) and Duroc-crossbred (IBxDU) Iberian pigs, which show important differences in meat quality and production traits, such as muscle growth and fatness. This experiment was conducted to investigate gene expression differences, transcriptional regulation and genetic polymorphisms that could be associated with the observed phenotypic differences between IB and IBxDU pigs. Nine IB and 10 IBxDU pigs were slaughtered at birth. Morphometric measures and blood samples were obtained and samples from Biceps femoris muscle were employed for compositional and transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq technology. Phenotypic differences were evident at this early age, including greater body size and weight in IBxDU and greater Biceps femoris intramuscular fat and plasma cholesterol content in IB newborns. We detected 150 differentially expressed genes between IB and IBxDU neonates (p < 0.01 and Fold-Change > 1. 5). Several were related to adipose and muscle tissues development (DLK1, FGF21 or UBC). The functional interpretation of the transcriptomic differences revealed enrichment of functions and pathways related to lipid metabolism in IB and to cellular and muscle growth in IBxDU. Protein catabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis and immune system were functions enriched in both genotypes. We identified transcription factors potentially affecting the observed gene expression differences. Some of them have known functions on adipogenesis (CEBPA, EGRs), lipid metabolism (PPARGC1B) and myogenesis (FOXOs, MEF2D, MYOD1), which suggest a key role in the meat quality differences existing between IB and IBxDU hams. We also identified several polymorphisms showing differential segregation between IB and IBxDU pigs. Among them, non-synonymous variants were detected in several transcription factors as PPARGC1B gene, which could be associated to altered gene function. Taken together, these results provide information about candidate genes, metabolic pathways and genetic polymorphisms potentially involved in phenotypic differences between IB and IBxDU associated to meat quality and production traits. Overall design: In total 12 biceps femoris samples were analyzed, 6 coming from purebred Iberian male newborns and 6 coming from crossbred male newborns (IberianxDuroc)	19

In this study, deep sequencing of endometrial RNA samples during early pregnancy were performed using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The changes of genes expressed among three stages (day 12, 18 and 25) of pregnancy were investigated by the multiple comparisons. Analysis of reads, between 1557 and 8951 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were revealed among different periods of implantation. Expression of selected genes was validated by the use of quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed genes in the endometrium revealed a number of biological processes and pathways potentially involved in embryo implantation in the pig, most noticeably cell proliferation, regulation of immune response, interaction of cytokine-cytokine receptor, and cell adhesion. This revealed specific gene expression patterns reflecting the different functions of the endometrium on three stages (maternal recognition, conceptus attachment and embryo implantation). This study identified comprehensive transcriptomic profile in the porcine endometrium, it could be a foundation for targeted studies of genes and pathways potentially involved in abnormal endometrial receptivity and embryo loss in early pregnancy. Overall design: Porcine endometrium mRNA profiles during early pregnancy were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq2000.	19

SRP065669	Oviduct-Embryo Interactions in Cattle: Two-Way Traffic or a One-Way Street? [RNA-Seq]	The objective of this study was to examine the effect of the presence of a single or multiple embryo(s) on the transcriptome of the bovine oviduct. In Experiment 1, cyclic (non-bred, n = 6) and pregnant (artificially inseminated, n = 11) heifers were slaughtered on Day 3 after estrus, and the ampulla and isthmic regions of the oviduct ipsilateral to the corpus luteum were separately flushed. Oviductal epithelial cells from the isthmus region, in which all oocytes/embryos were located, were snap-frozen for microarray analysis. In Experiment 2, heifers were divided into cyclic (non-bred, n = 6) or pregnant (multiple embryo transfer, n = 10) groups. In vitro-produced presumptive zygotes were transferred endoscopically to the ipsilateral oviduct on Day 1.5 post estrus (n = 50 zygotes per heifer). Heifers were slaughtered on Day 3 and oviductal isthmus epithelial cells were recovered for RNA sequencing. Microarray analysis in Experiment 1 failed to detect any difference in the transcriptome of the oviductal isthmus induced by the presence of a single embryo. In Experiment 2, following multiple embryo transfer, RNA sequencing revealed 278 differentially expressed genes of which 123 were up- and 155 were down-regulated in pregnant heifers. Most of the down-regulated genes were related to immune function. Overall design: Transcriptional profiles of oviductal isthmus epithelial cells from cyclic and pregnant heifers were generated by sequencing of total RNA on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform	19
SRP066249	Identification of genes in longissimus dorsi muscle differentially expressed between Wannanhua and Yorkshire pigs using RNA sequencing	Western commercial pig breeds have been intensively selected, resulting in a sizeable, rapid, and efficient accretion of muscle but a reduction in meat quality. When compared with Western commercial pig breeds, Chinese indigenous pig breeds exhibited slower growth rates and reduced lean meat content but superior perceived meat quality. To study the factors that determine meat quality, we examined piglets of one Western commercial breed (Yorkshire) and one Chinese indigenous breed (Wannanhua) and sequenced the longissimus dorsi muscle using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We analyzed their transcriptomes, focusing on identifying candidate genes that may influence porcine muscle growth, meat quality and adipose deposition. Gene ontology functional enrichment and pathway enrichment analyses identified differentially expressed genes primarily associated with glycolytic metabolism, biological processes of muscle development and signaling pathways related to fatty acid metabolism, growth and carcass traits. This finding suggests that the differentially expressed genes may play important roles in determining meat quality traits. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed the differential expression of twelve selected differentially expressed genes. This study identified a number of novel candidate genes for porcine meat quality and carcass traits that merit further investigation to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for muscle growth and fat deposition. Overall design: Examined piglets of Yorkshire pig and Wannanhua pig and sequenced the longissimus dorsi muscle using RNA-sequencing .	19

This study used RNA-sequencing to characterize the whole blood transcriptional response to PRRSV in pregnant gilts during the first week of infection, and attempted to identify gene expression signatures associated with a low or high level of fetal mortality at necropsy, 21 days post-inoculation. Overall design: RNA-sequencing experiment compared whole blood gene expression in two groups of gilts: a low fetal mortality group (LFM) and a high fetal mortality (HFM) group (n=8 per group). Two sets of contrasts were perfromed. First, a time-course experiment in which gene expression at day 2 (D2) post-inoculation was compared to day 0 (D0-just prior to inoculation) and expression at day 6 post-inoculation was compared to D2. Second, a comparison of gene expression between LFM and HFM groups at each of the three time-points (D0, D2, and D6).	19

SRP068062	Transcriptome responses to selection for tame/aggressive behaviors in silver foxes (Vulpes vulpes)	Domestication leads to a spectrum of striking behavioral changes whose genetic basis remains largely unknown. Silver foxes have been selectively bred for tame and aggressive behaviors for over 50 years at the Institute for Cytology and Genetics in Novosibirsk, Russia. To further understand the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms underlying tame and aggressive behavioral phenotypes segregating in selected strains of the silver fox, we quantified genome-wide gene expression levels using RNA-seq in two selected brain tissues, right prefrontal cortex and basal forebrain, from 12 aggressive and 12 tame individuals. Expression analysis reveals 146 differentially expressed genes in prefrontal cortex between tame and aggressive individuals at a 5% FDR, and 33 hits were found in basal forebrain. These candidates include genes in key pathways known to be critical to neurological processing, such as serotonin and glutamate receptor pathways. The data relate in interesting ways to neurological and pharmacological effects that are actively being studied to understand human aggression. In addition, we identified 31,000 high quality exonic SNPs, 295 of which show significant allele frequency differences between tame and aggressive individuals at an adjust P-value < 0.05 level from gene dropping simulation based on the entire pedigrees. A non-synonymous change in a glutamate receptor, GRM3, is among these significant SNPs, indicating that expression and allele-frequency changes are hitting the same pathways. These changes in expression level and allele frequency might be the direct response to the artificial selection and will help understand the genetic basis of mammalian domestication process. Overall design: Profile of transcriptome-wide gene expression levels in 1.5-year old tame and aggressive fox brain	19
SRP068231	Genome-wide differential expression of genes and small RNAs in testis of two different porcine breeds and at two different ages	Lu Chuan (LC, a Chinese local pig breed) and Yorkshire boars were generally considered as being pretty different in the time point and process of sexual maturation. Some documented evidences proved small RNAs (sRNA) and targeted genes are involved in mammalian testicular development and spermatogenesis. However, the detailed molecular regulation mechanisms of them remain largely unknown so far. We used the deep sequencing technology to characterize and identify the similarities and diversities of the expression and regulation of mRNAs, miRNAs and piRNAs which are possibly related to spermatogenesis and testicular development in different pig breeds at different stages of sexual maturity. In this study, we obtained a total of 10,716 mRNAs, 67 miRNAs and 16,953 piRNAs which were differentially expressed between LC and LW pig breeds or between the two sexual maturity stages. Of which, we identified 16 miRNAs and 28 targeted genes possibly related to spermatogenesis; 14 miRNAs and 18 targeted genes probably associated with cell adhesion related testis development. We also annotated 579 piRNAs which could potentially regulate cell death, nucleosome organization and other basic biology process, which implied that those piRNAs might be involved in sexual maturation difference. The integrated network analysis results suggested that some differentially expressed genes were involved in spermatogenesis through the ECMâ€“receptor interaction, focal adhesion, Wnt and PI3Kâ€“Akt signaling pathways, some particular miRNAs have the negative regulation roles and some special piRNAs have the positive and negative regulation roles in testicular development. Our data provide novel insights into the molecular expression and regulation similarities and diversities of spermatogenesis and testicular development in different pig breeds at different stages of sexual maturity. Overall design: LC and LW boars considerably differ in sexual maturation time; LW boars reach maturity at ~180 days old (Egbunike 1979), whereas LC boars reach maturity at 90 days old (Huang Ya-qiong et al. 2013). We dissected the testes from three LC and LW boars aged 20 days (sexual immaturity, B) and 200 days ( maturity, A). No genetic linkage was present between the three LC boars or three LW boars at 20 or 200Â days old. The similarities and diversities for the two pig breeds were analyzed from the RNA-seq and small RNA-seq.	19
SRP068422	Characterisation of the whole blood mRNA transcriptome in Holstein-Friesian and Jersey calves in response to gradual weaning	The objectives of the study were to use RNA-Seq to examine the effect of (i) breed and (ii) gradual weaning, on the whole blood mRNA transcriptome of artificially reared Holstein-Friesian and Jersey calves. The calves were gradually weaned over 14 days (day (d) -13 to d 0) and mRNA transcription was examined one day before gradual weaning was initiated (d -14), one day after weaning (d 1) and 8 days after weaning (d 8). RNA-seq analysis was carried out on RNA extracted from whole blood. Gradual weaning had no effect on gene expression (P>0.05).There were 550 differentially expressed genes at a false discovery rate of 10% and with a =1.5-fold change, between Holstein-Friesian and Jersey calves on d -14, 490 on d 1, and 411 on d 8. GOseq/KEGG pathway analysis showed that the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway and the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway were over-represented between breeds on all days (P<0.01; Q=0.1). These results demonstrate that the gradual weaning practiced here does not compromise the welfare of artificially-reared dairy calves, evidenced by the lack of expression changes in any genes in response to gradual weaning. These data also suggest differences in cell signalling and immune responses between breeds. Overall design: Eight Holstein-Friesian and eight Jersey bull calves were group housed indoors and individually fed milk replacer and concentrate using an automatic feeder. Calves were gradually weaned by reducing milk-replacer from 6 litres to 0 litres over 14 days (d) (d -13 to d 0). Calves were blood sampled on d -14, 1, and 8, relative to weaning (d 0). RNA-seq analysis was carried out on RNA extracted from whole blood.	19

SRP072192	RNA-Sequencing for Additional Molar Germs Transcriptomes at Stages of Early Development in Miniature Pigs	The molecular mechanisms of the regulatory network of mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs during sequential formation of additional molars remain poorly characterized in diphyodont mammals. The diphyodont miniature pig has proved to be a valuable model for studying human molar morphogenesis. Here, we performed RNA-seq on miniature pigs at three molar developmental stages to examine their differential gene expression profiles and potential regulatory networks during additional molar morphogenesis. Many new unannotated genes plus putative long non-coding RNAs were identified. Our data provide fundamental knowledge and a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms governing cascade initiation of additional molars.

SRP072500	Comparison of crossbred and purebred cattle by bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed transcripts	Background: Transcriptomic variation among cattle breeds and their crossbreds may help to better understanding of consequences of crossbreeding and heterosis. In this study the differences in biological functions and pathways of three crossbreds including 50 and 75 percent Holstein were compared with their purebred parents, Holstein and Taleshi (an indigenous breed) cattle. Results: Five populations and their ten comparisons were studied by bioinformatics tools for transcriptome analysis. We pooled blood RNA of at least 8 animals of each population prior to RNA sequencing. The obtained results showed that total expressed transcripts in all populations were 72,812 with 22,627 annotated genes. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that the genetics information processing and metabolism were the most highly-impacted pathways. Among all significantly enriched pathways, eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2 signaling had the highest activation z-score (5.3) in crossbred compared to purebred cattle. The majority of upstream regulators of genes including transcription regulators and cytokines were differentially expressed among populations in which their activation z-score in purebred was more than crossbred cattle. Conclusions: Crossing of Holstein with Taleshi breed resulted in higher activity of pathways related to genetic information processing and lower activity of pathways related to immunity and inflammatory responses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where the differences in pathways and functions were studied using high throughput sequencing of blood in a cattle crossbreeding program. The analysis revealed that the most important differences between studied genotypes, especially between purebred and crossbred cattle, were related to immune functions and metabolism. Overall design: the blood transcriptome of five cattle populations including two purebreds and the three crossbreds of them. Please note that three crossbreds have different parents and different blood share of their purebred parents; 50CSN is 50 percent crossbred sire Iran native cattle and dam Holstein, 50CSH is 50 percent crossbred sire Holstein and dam Iran native cattle, and 75C is 75 percent Holstein and 25 percent Iran native cattle.	19

Methods: gene expression profiles of longissimus muscle from 4 cattle mRNA pools including 6 control and 6 NA treated cattle were generated by single-end sequencing (50 bp), using Illumina HiSeqâ„¢ 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality control were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. Results: Using SOAPaligner (V2.21) analysis, we mapped about 23,359,272-25,165,811 clean reads per sample to the bovine reference genome assembly (unmasked genomic DNA sequences: Bos_taurus.UMD3.1.75.dna.chromosome.1-29 and X) (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-75/fasta/bos_taurus/dna/). Our NOISeq analysis identified a list of 124 differentially expressed genes with a probability value = 0.8 and an absolute value of log2 Ratio of NA to Control = 1. Conclusions: In our study, dietary NA increases the IMF content of longissimus muscle may through up-regulating the expressions of genes and pathways related to lipid metabolism. Overall design: Four mRNA profiles of 6 control and 6 NA treated cattle were generated by single-end sequencing (50 bp), using Illumina HiSeqâ„¢ 2000.	19

The goals of this study are to identify whether alternative splicing sites or alternative 3'' gene boundary caused by a CNV located in 3'' region of MSRB3 gene and find differential expression genes in ear tissue between QQ and qq genotype piglets for QTL of ear size Methods: Ear tissue mRNA profiles of 6 piglets including 3 QQ and 3 qq genotypes responsible for QTL of ear size were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with TopHat followed by Cufflinks. Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 93.6-95.3 million 2 x 90 bp paired-end clean reads per sample to the pig genome (Sscrofa 10.2) and identify 19,819-20,136 annotated genes in each sample. Our ranking analysis identified a list of 281 differentially expressed genes with a >1 fold change at a false discovery rate lower than 0.001. But we found no alternative transcripts and differential expression of MSRB3 gene. Conclusions: In our study, the expression levels of MSRB3 gene had no significant difference in the ear tissue between QQ and qq individuals, and no alternative splicing was found for MSRB3 gene between QQ and qq individuals. Overall design: Ear tissue mRNA profiles of 3 QQ and 3 qq genotype piglets were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq 2000.	19

SRP076473	Transcriptomal analysis revealed that the metabolism and structure of porcine Longissimus Dorsi muscle were changed by constant heat stress	To characterize the changes of mRNAs in skeletal muscle responding to heat stress, the mRNA expression profiles of longissimus dorsi muscles of pigs raised under constant heat stress (30Â°C, n=8) or control temperature (22 C, n=8) for 21 days were analyzed by Illumina high-throughput sequencing. There were 78 genes differentially expressed, of which 37 were up-regulated and 41 down-regulated by constant heat stress. In summary, 5,247 novel genes and 6,108 novel transcribed units in the skeletal muscle were identified. Furthermore, 30,761 and 31,360 AS events were observed in CON and H30 libraries, respectively. The differentially expressed genes in the muscle were involved in glycolysis, lactate metabolism, lipid metabolism, cellular defense, and stress responses. The expression levels of those genes were associated with the parameters of meat quality, indicating that heat stress affected meat quality by regulating genes associated with nutrition metabolism and muscle development. Overall design: Characterize and compare expression profiling of the mRNA transcriptome in 2 groups of porcine skeletal muscle.	19
SRP077232	A porcine gluteus medius muscle genome-wide transcriptome analysis: dietary effects of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids on biological mechanisms	The level of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may affect many cellular systems and functions via nuclear receptors or the bioactive lipid regulation of gene expression. The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in the muscle transcriptome and the biological functions regulated by increased consumption of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in the pig gluteus medius muscle. The transcriptome of the gluteus medius muscle was studied for pigs subjected to either a control diet or a diet supplemented with linseed and rapeseed oil to increase polyunsaturated fatty acid content. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to generate the muscle tissue transcriptome database. The results of the NGS indicate a role of the fatty acids in the regulation of the expression of genes essential for muscle tissue development and functioning. Functional analysis revealed that the identified genes were important for a number of biological processes including protein development, signaling, inflammatory response, membranes, and lipid metabolism. The genes that were expressed specifically in only one of the dietary groups were responsible for many of the same processes listed above, indicating that biological processes were strongly modulated and tended to switch between coherent stages in response to increased levels of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids. Several nuclear receptors regulating transcription showed altered expression, including hepatocyte nuclear factor-4a (HNF4alpha), carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP), and nuclear factor ?B (NFkappa?). We suggest that the identified changes were largely due to regulation of those transcription factors. Our results provide strong evidence that n-6 and n-3 fatty acids regulate fundamental metabolic processes in muscle tissue development and functioning. Overall design: Muscle mRNA profiles of Polish Landrace pig breed fed two different diets were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. Experimental diet was enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-6 and omega-3), while standard diet remain as a control. 2 pooled samples, each containing RNA extracts from gluteus medius muscle of 6 individuals, were analyzed.	19

SRP081047	Host mechanisms potentially associated with foodborne pathogen Escherichia coli O157 shedding in feedlot beef cattle	Cattle shedding > 10e4 CFU of Escherichia coli O157 per g of feces are defined as super-shedders. RNA-sequencing was performed to identify the transcriptome of tissues, including duodenum, proximal jejunum, distal jejunum, distal jejunum, cecum, spiral colon and descending colon of super-shedder cattle in comparison with non-shedders. The total number of genes detected in gut tissues ranged from 16,846 Â± 639 (cecum) to 18,137 Â± 696 (distal jejunum), and immune functions were enriched for the transcriptomes of small intestinal tissues, reflecting their greater immune activity than large intestine. Totally 351 differentially expression genes were identified between super-shedders and non-shedders, including 101 up-regulated and 250 down-regulated in super-shedders. Differential gene expression analysis suggested increased T-cell responses and cholesterol absorption in distal jejunum and descending colon, and inhibited B-cell maturation in intestines of super-shedders. distal jejunum of super-shedders. Our findings suggested that host genetics and E. coli O157 activities are involved in super-shedding phenomenon. Overall design: We performed a differential analysis of transcriptomes of gut tissues collected from E. coli O157 super-shedders and non-shedders (control), to study molecular mechanisms of super-shedding phenomenon. It is a case control study.	19

SRP082457	Transcriptomic and epigenetic responses to social challenge and their association with future behavior in honey bees (RNA-Seq)	We studied behavioral, brain transcriptomic and epigenetic responses of honey bees to social challenge. Bees were exposed to two intruders at different intervals. The initial exposure caused two behavioral effects at the individual level: an increase in the intensity of aggression toward a second intruder at 30 and 60 minutes, and an increased probability of responding aggressively toward a second intruder that persisted for two hours. The shorter-lived response was associated with one pattern of gene expression in the mushroom bodies, highlighted by genes related to cytoskeleton remodeling. The longer-lived response was associated with a different pattern; highlighted by genes related to hormones, stress response and transcription factors. Histone profiling revealed few changes in chromatin accessibility in response to social challenge; most differentially expressed genes were *ready* to be activated. These results demonstrate how biological embedding of a social challenge involves changes in the neurogenomic state to influence future behavior. Overall design: There are a total of 180 samples equally balanced between 3 factors: 90 challenge (X) and 90 control (C); 60 30m, 60 60m, and 60 120m; 60 colony R02, 60 colony R03, and 60 colony R21. The control and experimental samples are paired. We excluded a total of 26 samples with a proportion of reads mapping to the Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) genome of = 0.005.	19
SRP083002	RNA sequencing data from pigs with high and low intramuscular fat content.	Intramuscular fat (IMF) content in pork is an important element of consumer preference, and is positively correlated with meat quality, including tenderness and juiciness. With advances in RNA sequencing technologies, transcriptome-related differences can be associated with specific traits in animals. The objective of this study was to investigate the differentially expressed genes (DEG) closely related with IMF content in porcine longissimus muscle using RNA sequencing. A total of 107 Berkshire pigs were used for IMF content measurements and significant difference between extremely high (H, n=3) and low (L, n=3) IMF content groups was found (P < 0.0001). From multi-dimensional scaling analyses, it was observed that the relationships between H and L groups were similar to each other. Here, we identified a total of 134 genes that were differentially expressed between the groups (FDR < 0.05, and FC = 2). Functional analyses with DEGs revealed that the lipid metabolism (SCD and FASN) was one of the significant biological processes related with IMF content determination. In addition, we also found that DEGs related with muscle regeneration (MYOG and VEGFA) and extracellular matrix (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL5A1, COL14A1, and COL15A1) were changed between individuals with the extreme IMF contents, interestingly. These results will aid in understanding the regulation of IMF contents in pigs. Overall design: The mRNA profiles in longissimus muslce from pig with high (n=3) and low (n=3) intramuscular fat contents were generated by an Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencing System.	19
SRP083944	Reduced representation bisulphite sequencing of ten bovine somatic tissues reveals DNA methylation patterns and their impacts on gene expression [RNA-Seq]	As a key epigenetic modification, DNA methylation is essential for normal development by regulating processes like gene expression, genomic imprinting, and suppression of repetitive elements. However, DNA methylation in the cattle genome is not well understood. Here we presented the first single-base-resolution maps of DNA methylation in 10 diversely somatic tissues harvested from the sequenced Hereford cow L1 Dominette 01449 and her relatives using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS). In total, we observed 1,868,049 high accuracy cytosines that located in the CG enriched regions. Similar to the methylation patterning in other species, the CG context was predominant methylated. Widespread differences were identified between the methylation patterns of CG and non-CG contexts. They were distributed differentially among the genomic features, including the genic regions, CpG islands, and repetitive sequences. Autocorrelation analysis among adjacent residues illustrated that methylation level of CGs were highly correlated in a region. In contrast, weak or no correlation was found among non-CGs or between CGs and non-CGs. The distinct distribution and low correlation of CG and non-CG methylation suggested that non-CG methylation may be independent from CG methylation and may be mediated by different mechanisms. We also detected 798 tissue-specific differentially methylated cytosines (tDMC) and 131 tissue-specific differentially methylated CpG islands. Combined analysis with the RNA-seq data, we discovered several non-CGs in tDMCs also highly correlated with gene expression, which implied the potential function of non-CG methylation in somatic cells in addition to pluripotent cells. In summary, we showed that non-CGs exist in bovine tissues and some of them were correlated with tissue-specific functions. This study provided essential information for the cytosine methylation patterning in bovine somatic tissues. Overall design: We applied RNA_seq for 8 different tissues to detect the effects of methylation on gene expression.	19
SRP086568	Longissimus dorsi muscle transcriptome in pure and crossbred Iberian pigs at birth and growing stages	Iberian ham production includes both purebred (IB) and Duroc-crossbred (IBxDU) Iberian pigs, which show important differences in meat quality and production traits, such as muscle growth and fatness. This experiment was conducted to investigate gene expression differences that could be associated with the observed phenotypic differences between IB and IBxDU pigs. Nine IB and 10 IBxDU pigs were slaughtered at birth, and seven IB and 10 IBxDU at four months of age (growing period). Muscle transcriptome was analyzed on LD samples with RNA-Seq technology. We detected 261 differentially expressed genes between IB and IBxDU neonates and 113 at growth (p < 0.01 and Fold-Change > 1. 5). Newborns transcriptome reflected a highly proliferative developmental stage, while older pigs showed upregulation of catabolic and muscle functioning processes. Regarding the genetic type effect, IBxDU newborns showed enrichment of gene pathways involved in muscle growth, in agreement with the higher prenatal growth observed in these pigs. However, IB growing pigs showed enrichment of pathways involved in protein deposition and cellular growth, supporting the catch-up growth experienced by IB pigs during this period. Moreover, newborn and growing IB pigs showed more active glucose and lipid metabolism than IBxDU pigs. Overall design: In total 24 longissimus dorsi samples were analyzed, 6 coming from purebred Iberian male newborns and 6 coming from crossbred male newborns (IberianxDuroc), at each stage (birth and four months of age)	19
SRP089739	The developmental transcriptome profiling reveals an abundant GosB that regulates cell cycle, proliferation and apoptosis	Background: In bovines, the development and growth of skeletal muscle involves many physiological processes and plays an extremely important role in the quality of beef, however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differences in meat quality are largely unknown. Therefore, a cattle muscle transcriptome analysis was performed to compare gene expression profiles between embryonic stage and adult stage. Results: Total RNAs from the Qinchuan cattle skeletal muscle at fetal and adult stages were used to construct libraries for Illumina next-generation sequencing using Ribo-Zero RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) method. We found a total of 19,695 genes were expressed in the embryo and adult, and 3,299 and 433 genes were present only in the embryo and adult, respectively. Over 5,000 unigenes were significantly different (P < 0.05) when comparing fetal and adult patterns. We further characterized GosB, which was abundant in skeletal muscle, as the candidate gene to explore its role in cattle development. GosB increased the number of C2C12 myoblasts in S phase, and decreased the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase. GosB promoted proliferation and protect the C2C12 cells from apoptosis via regulating Bcl-2 expression and controlling the intracellular calcium concentration. Conclusions: Modulation of GosB expression in muscle tissue may emerge as potent tool to control myoblast number in the cattle. Overall design: Six longissimus muscle samples from Qinchuan cattles of two developmental states (embryonic, 90 d; and adult, 24 M old) were collected from Yiming abattoir, a local slaughterhouse of Xiâ€™An, P.R. China.	19

SRP094623	Anguilla anguilla Transcriptome or Gene expression	Understanding the mechanisms underlying morphological/phenotypic dimorphism and plasticity, including the genomic basis and links to ecological influences, remains one of the major challenges in evolutionary biology. One prime example of phenotypically plastic species distributed along various environmental gradients is the European eel, Anguilla anguilla. At the juvenile (yellow eel) stage of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla), two morphotypes are found: broad- and narrow-heads. This dimorphism has been linked to dietary differences, with broad-heads feeding on harder and larger prey than narrow-heads. However, recent research showed that both morphotypes could already be distinguished at the glass eel stage, the non-feeding predecessor of the yellow eel stage, implying that factors other than trophic segregation play a role in the development of this head shape dimorphism. Here, we used gene transcription profiling (RNAseq) to identify significantly differential expressed genes between broad- and narrow-headed glass eels. Identification of these genes would strongly increase our understanding of the mechanism behind this dimorphism and its ecological implications. We found 260 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between the morphotypes, of which most were related to defense and immune responses. Interestingly, two genes involved in growth (soma and igf2) were significantly up-regulated in narrow-heads, while also nine genes involved in chemotaxis showed a significant differential expression. As such, we found support for the observation that head shape is also associated with somatic growth, with fast-growing eels developing a narrower head. Additionally, observations in the wild have shown that slow-growers prefer freshwater, while fast-growers prefer brackish water. The differential expression of genes involved in chemotaxis indeed seems to indicate that glass eel growth rate and habitat choice are related to each other. We hence hypothesize that two levels of segregations could take place in the European eel: first according to habitat choice, secondly according to feeding preference.	19
SRP094841	Transcriptional profiling by next generation sequencing of the spleen and splenic macrophages in the hamster model of visceral leishmaniasis	We used next generation sequencing to examine global changes in gene expression in the spleen and splenic macrophages in a hamster model of progressive visceral leishmaniasis. We used RNA sequencing coupled with de novo transcriptome assembly, because the Syrian hamster does not have a fully sequenced and annotated reference genome. Libraries for deep sequencing were constructed from poly-A RNA isolated from the spleens or splenic macrophages of uninfected and 28-day L. donovani-infected hamsters (n=4 per group) using standard Illumina protocols. The library quality was confirmed by Agilent Bioanalyzer. Paired-end 50-base sequencing was performed using TruSeq SBS kit v3 (Illumina) on an Illumina HiSeq 1000.The quality of raw sequencing reads was checked using FastQC (v0.10.1). To avoid the contamination of pathogen sequences, we filtered out reads (using the FASTX Toolkit v0.0.13) that aligned to the Leishmania donovani BPK282A1 genome (NCBI BioProject PRJEA61817) using Bowtie 2 (v2.0.0-beta5) under default options. To reduce the effect of low quality reads, we further filtered out artifacts and reads having a phred score <28 in more than 10% of nucleotides using FASTX Toolkit (v0.0.13). Both forward and reverse reads were removed if any of them failed to pass the filters. To obtain a complete transcriptome, we used two steps. First, the cleaned sequencing reads from different spleen samples were pooled together and de novo assembled using Trinity software. Second, the resulting transcriptome was combined with all cleaned reads from hamster spleen and splenic macrophages and the CHO-K1 RefSeq genome to perform a second de novo assembly using BRANCH. We first created a customized reference library using Rattus norvegicus (Rnor_5.0.73) and Mus musculus (GRCm38.73) genomes. We then used BLAST (v 2.2.28+) to align each transcript generated from BRANCH against the customized library to assign it a gene name based upon sequence similarity. An E-value cutoff of <1e-3 was used. Additionally, we compared the Trinity transcripts with the CHO-K1 Ref Seq genome. All the non-Leishmania-like raw sequencing reads were first mapped to our de novo reference genome using Bowtie2 (v2.1.0) with default options, but allowing one read to map to as many as 500 different transcripts. We then measured the expression abundance, count of reads mapped to each transcript, using the software eXpress. To identify differentially expressed transcripts in each experiment, 3 different approaches were applied: exact tests of Robinson and Smyth and generalized linear models with the likelihood ratio test using the BioConductor R package EdgeR, and the Wald test using DESeq2. Only transcripts with at least 1 count per million in at least 3 out of 4 samples in the control or experimental group were included in the analysis. A transcript was considered differentially expressed only when it was identified by all three different approaches. Analysis of differentially expressed transcripts identified a highly inflammatory spleen environment with abundant expression of type I and type II interferon response genes. However, high IFN-? expression was ineffective in directing exclusive M1 macrophage polarization, suppressing M2-associated gene expression, and restraining parasite replication and disease. While many IFN-inducible transcripts were upregulated in the infected spleen, fewer were induced in splenic macrophages in VL suggesting suppression of macrophage responsiveness to activating cytokines. The transcription factor STAT3 was predicted and confirmed to be activated, and found to orchestrate an exuberant counter-regulatory response that favors parasite replication. Overall design: Transcriptional profiles of 28-day Leishmania donovani infected Syrian outbred hamsters were generated by deep sequencing, in quadruplicate, using Illumina Illumina HiSeq 1000	19
SRP095120	RNA-Seq transcriptomics and pathway analyses reveal potential regulatory genes and molecular mechanisms in high- and low-feed efficient Nordic dairy cattle	The study investigated gene expression patterns in liver tissue to understand the biological functions of genes that are potentially involved in controlling / regulating feed efficiency in Nordic dairy cattle. Overall design: Comparison of liver transcriptome from 2 cattle breeds (Holstein and Jersey), 2 levels of feed efficiency (FE) (High and low), 2 types of feed diet (Control (C) and High concentrate diet (HC)). Within each breed, there are 5 High FE and 5 Low FE cows. Notes: each of the animals received both of the diet (C and HC) after conditioning period (14 to26 days intervals). One cow from Holstein was dropped from the study because of the unsuccessful liver biopsy sampling.	19

SRP095839	Identification of Genes Related to Growth and Lipid Deposition from Transcriptome Profiles of Pig Muscle Tissue [mRNA]	RNA sequences (from RNA-seq) from the tissues of longissimus dorsi muscle of two indigenous Chinese pig breeds (Diannan Small Ear pig [DSP] and Tibetan pig [TP]) and two introduced pig breeds (Landrace [LL] and Yorkshire [YY]) were examined using HiSeq 2000 to identify and compare the differential expression of functional genes related to muscle growth and lipid deposition. We obtained 27.18 G clean data through the RNA-seq and detected that 18,208 genes were positively expressed and 14,633 of them were co-expressed in the muscle tissues of the four samples. In all, 315 DEGs were found between the Chinese pig group and the introduced pig group, 240 of which were enriched with functional annotations from the David database and significantly enriched in 27 Gene Ontology (GO) terms that were mainly associated with muscle fiber contraction, cadmium ion binding, response to organic substance and contractile fiber part. Based on functional annotation, we identified 85 DEGs related to growth traits that were mainly involved in muscle tissue development, muscle system process, regulation of cell development, and growth factor binding, and 27 DEGs related to lipid deposition that were mainly involved in lipid metabolic process and fatty acid biosynthetic process. Overall design: RNA sequences from the tissues of longissimus dorsi muscle of two indigenous Chinese pig breeds (Diannan Small Ear pig [DSP] and Tibetan pig [TP]) and two introduced pig breeds (Landrace [LL] and Yorkshire [YY]) were examined using HiSeq 2000.	19

SRP097223	Comparative transcriptomic analysis provides insights into high-altitude adaptation	Purpose: High-altitude adaptive evolution of transcription, and the convergence and divergence of transcriptional alteration across species in response to high-altitude environments, is an important topic of broad interest to the general biology community. Our study aims to answer this important biological question. Methods: We generated deep transcriptome data of high- and low- altitude populations across four species: chicken, pig, goat and sheep, as well as high-altitude yak and low-altitude cattle, from six tissues (heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle and spleen). Results: Here we provide a comprehensive comparative transcriptome landscape of expression and alternative splicing variation between low- and high-altitude populations across multiple species for distinct tissues. Conclusions: Our data serves a valuable resource for further study on adaptive transcription evolution and identification of candidate adaptive genes. Overall design: RNA-seq data from 138 samples derived from six tissues (heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle and spleen) of three unrelated adult females for each of five animals (chicken, pig, cattle/yak, sheep and goat) from high- and low-altitude regions.	19

SRP101596	Manis javanica Raw sequence reads	The Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica), an unusual mammal that is a scale-covered, toothless specialist myrmecophage, is maintained primarily through captive breeding in China. Maintaining this species in captivity is a significant challenge partly because little is known about its behavior and reproduction. The molecular mechanisms of its digestive system play a key role in the feeding and dietary husbandry of pangolins in captivity. Here, we performed the first large-scale sequencing of M. javanica transcriptomes from three digestive organs-the salivary glands, liver, and small intestine-by using Illumina HiSeq technology- to provides useful genetic resources for future functional work that may be relevant for the maintenance of captive pangolins.	19
SRP101968	Temporal Dynamics of Neurogenomic Plasticity in Response to Social Interactions in Male Threespined Sticklebacks [RNA-Seq]	Animals exhibit dramatic immediate behavioral plasticity in response to social interactions, and brief social interactions can shape the future social landscape. However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to behavioral plasticity are unclear. Here, we show that the genome dynamically responds to social interactions with multiple waves of transcription associated with distinct molecular functions in the brain of male threespined sticklebacks, a species famous for its behavioral repertoire and evolution. Some biological functions (e.g., hormone activity) peaked soon after a brief territorial challenge and then declined, while others (e.g., immune response) peaked hours afterwards. We identify transcription factors that are predicted to coordinate waves of transcription associated with different components of behavioral plasticity. Next, using H3K27Ac as a marker of chromatin accessibility, we show that a brief territorial intrusion was sufficient to cause rapid and dramatic changes in the epigenome. Finally, we integrate the time course brain gene expression data with a transcriptional regulatory network, and link gene expression to changes in chromatin accessibility. This study reveals rapid and dramatic epigenomic plasticity in response to a brief, highly consequential social interaction. Overall design: Adult males were collected from Putah Creek, a freshwater population, in spring 2013 and maintained in the lab on a 16:8 (L:D) photoperiod and at 18° C in separate 9-liter tanks. Males were provided with nesting material including algae, sand and gravel and were visually isolated from neighbors. All males were in the *territorial* phase of the nesting cycle, i.e. defending a territory. Males were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. Males in the experimental group were presented with a smaller, unrelated male intruder confined to a flask. Males in the control groups were presented with an empty flask. At the same time as a confined intruder was introduced to an experimental male's tank, an empty flask was introduced into a paired control male's tank. After 5 min the flask was removed, and after a predetermined period (see below) males were quickly netted and sacrificed by decapitation within seconds following an IACUC approved protocol (#15077) of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. For RNA Sequencing diencephalon and telencephalon tissue samples were collected 30, 60 or 120 minutes after the flask was introduced, with n=10 males per time point (5 experimental and 5 control).	19

SRP107390	Identification of differentially expressed genes in longissimus dorsi muscle between Wei and Yorkshire pigs using RNA-sequencing	Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is an important trait closely correlated with meat quality, which is highly variable among swine breeds from diverse genetic backgrounds. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying porcine meat quality, we adopted RNA-sequencing to detect transcriptome in the longissimus dorsi muscle of Wei pigs (a Chinese indigenous breed) and Yorkshire pigs (a Western lean-type breed) with different IMF content. A total of 717 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in our study, with 323 up-regulated and 394 down-regulated genes in Wei pigs compared with Yorkshire pigs. GO analysis showed that DEGs significantly related to muscle proliferation and development, lipid storage and catabolic, extracellular matrix structural constituent, and neutral amino acid transmembrane transporter activity. Pathway analysis revealed that DEGs associated with fatty acid metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, protein digestion and absorption, and amino acid metabolism. Quantitative real time PCR confirmed the differential expression of 11 selected DEGs from both pig breeds. The results provide useful information to investigate the transcriptional profiling in skeletal muscle of different pig breeds with divergent phenotypes, and several DEGs can be taken as functional candidate genes for affecting pork quality.

Through comparing the results of developmental transcritpomes from plumulaceous and flight feather, we found that DEGs belonging to the family of WNT, FGF and BMP have certain differences; even the consistent DEGs of skin and feather follicle transcriptomes from abdomen and wing have the different expression patterns. Overall design: A total of twelve libraries were sequenced from skin and feather follicle tissues of six groups (n=2 for each; control samples), including the early growth plumulaceous feathers (EP), middle growth plumulaceous feathers (MP), late growth plumulaceous feathers (LP), early growth flight feathers (EF), middle growth flight feathers (MF) and late growth flight feathers (LF).	19

SRP141481	Differential expression and co-expression gene networks reveal candidate biomarkers of boar taint in non-castrated pigs (RNA-seq data set)	Boar taint (BT) is an offensive odour or taste observed in pork from a proportion of non-castrated male pigs. Surgical castration is effective in avoiding BT, but animal welfare issues have created an incentive for alternatives such as genomic selection. In order to find candidate biomarkers, gene expression profiles were analysed from tissues of non-castrated pigs grouped by their genetic merit of BT. Differential expression analysis revealed substantial changes with log-transformed fold changes of liver and testis from -3.39 to 2.96 and -7.51 to 3.53, respectively. Co-expression network analysis revealed one module with a correlation of -0.27 in liver and three modules with correlations of 0.31, -0.44 and -0.49 in testis. Differential expression and co-expression analysis revealed candidate biomarkers with varying biological functions: phase I (COQ3, COX6C, CYP2J2, CYP2B6, ACOX2) and phase II metabolism (GSTO1, GSR, FMO3) of skatole and androstenone in liver to steroidgenesis (HSD17B7, HSD17B8, CYP27A1), regulation of steroidgenesis (STARD10, CYB5R3) and GnRH signalling (MAPK3, MAP2K2, MAP3K2) in testis. Overrepresented pathways included “Ribosome”, “Protein export” and “Oxidative phosphorylation” in liver and “Steroid hormone biosynthesis” and “Gap junction” in testis. Future work should evaluate the biomarkers in large populations to ensure their usefulness in genomic selection programs. Overall design: Total RNA was extracted from liver and testis of 48 Danish Landrace pigs with low- medium and high genetic merit of boar taint and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2500.	19
SRP142618	Dose-dependent transcriptomic responses of zebrafish embryos to Bisphenol A	Overall design: Whole embryo (5 dpf; wild type zebrafish) mRNA profiles of 4 groups (control, 0.1, 1 and 4 ppm of BPA) were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina TruSeq SBS Kit v3-HS (pair-ended) on a HiSeq2000 sequencing system.	19
SRP163252	Atlas of RNA sequencing profiles of normal human tissues	Overall design: A total of 148 solid tissue samples representing 20 organs were taken from post-mortal human healthy donors killed in road accidents no later than 36 hours after death. Prior to RNA extraction solid normal tissue samples were stored either in RNAlater or as Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) blocks. Blood and bone marrow samples were taken from 6 and 11 healthy volunteers respectively and subjected immediately to RNA extraction. Following ribosomal RNA depletion and RNA libraries construction transcription profiles of the samples were obtained using Illumina HiSeq 3000.	19
SRP188583	Different expression of genes on gills from turbot scophthalmus maximus that fed with different contents of myo-inositol	In this study, whole genome transcription profiling of turbot as it fed with different contents myo-inositol was performed to decipher the mechanisms by which myo-inositol modulates physiological functions	19
