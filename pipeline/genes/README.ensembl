To insert genes from an Ensembl source (Ensembl or Ensembl Metazoa)
you need the Ensembl API.

WARNING if Ensembl and Ensembl Metazoa are not sync, you will have to
        switch between Ensembl API versions!


Instructions about how to install the Ensembl API are available here
- http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_git.html


Set the *PERL5LIB* environment variable following these instructions:
- http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/api_installation.html


ACHTUNG! **ensembl-metadata** not by default with ensembl-git-tools;
and the same for **ensembl-taxonomy** but we need them!
