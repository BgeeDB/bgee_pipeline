PNAS (2002)"	"We have collected a set of 347 proteins that are found in eukaryotic cells but have no significant homology to proteins in Archaea and Bacteria. We call these proteins eukaryotic signature proteins (ESPs). The dominant hypothesis for the formation of the eukaryotic cell is that it is a fusion of an archaeon with a bacterium. If this hypothesis is accepted then the three cellular domains, Eukarya, Archaea, and Bacteria, would collapse into two cellular domains. We have used the existence of this set of ESPs to test this hypothesis. The evidence of the ESPs implicates a third cell (chronocyte) in the formation of the eukaryotic cell. [...] The eukaryotic cell is not a simple fusion of an archaeon and bacterium. This statement is borne out by the existence of 347 ESPs. [...] We agree with Horiike et al. that the nucleus is an endosymbiont with inputs from Bacteria and Archaea. We disagree that the host cell came from the Bacteria. The host cell or chronocyte was not a prokaryotic cell but one that had a cytoskeleton composed of actin and tubulin and an extensive membrane system."	bgee	ANN	2013-06-21

The term is applied here to the somatic cell of the germinal compartment, regardless of species or stage of development. Sertoli cells share a common origin with cells destined to form the collecting duct system of the testis and begin their association with germ cells early in spermatogenesis, even before definitive clone formation.

Microscopy Research and Technique (2010)"	"Spermatogenesis appears to be a fairly conserved process throughout the vertebrate series. (...) There is, however, variation amongst the vertebrates in how germ cell development and maturation is accomplished. This difference can be broadly divided into two distinct patterns, one present in anamniotes (fish, amphibia) and the other in amniotes (reptiles, birds, mammals). For anamniotes, spermatogenesis occurs in spermatocysts (cysts) which for most species develop within seminiferous lobules. Cysts are produced when a Sertoli cell becomes associated with a primary spermatogonium. Mitotic divisions of the primary spermatogonium produce a cohort of secondary spermatogonia that are enclosed by the Sertoli cell which forms the wall of the cyst. With spermatogenic progression a clone of isogeneic spermatozoa is produced which are released, by rupture of the cyst, into the lumen of the seminiferous lobule. Following spermiation, the Sertoli cell degenerates. For anamniotes, therefore, there is no permanent germinal epithelium since spermatocysts have to be replaced during successive breeding seasons. By contrast, spermatogenesis in amniotes does not occur in cysts but in seminiferous tubules that possess a permanent population of Sertoli cells and spermatogonia which act as a germ cell reservoir for succeeding bouts of spermatogenic activity. There is, in general, a greater variation in the organization of the testis and pattern of spermatogenesis in the anamniotes compared to amniotes."	bgee	ANN	2015-02-03

We call these proteins eukaryotic signature proteins (ESPs). The dominant hypothesis for the formation of the eukaryotic cell is that it is a fusion of an archaeon with a bacterium. If this hypothesis is accepted then the three cellular domains, Eukarya, Archaea, and Bacteria, would collapse into two cellular domains. We have used the existence of this set of ESPs to test this hypothesis. The evidence of the ESPs implicates a third cell (chronocyte) in the formation of the eukaryotic cell. [...] The eukaryotic cell is not a simple fusion of an archaeon and bacterium. This statement is borne out by the existence of 347 ESPs. [...] We agree with Horiike et al. that the nucleus is an endosymbiont with inputs from Bacteria and Archaea. We disagree that the host cell came from the Bacteria.

In particular, both cell types possess a specialized filtration diaphragm, known as the slit diaphragm in podocytes or the nephrocyte diaphragm in nephrocytes. We find that fly (Drosophila melanogaster) orthologues of the major constituents of the slit diaphragm, including nephrin, NEPH1 (also known as KIRREL), CD2AP, ZO-1 (TJP1) and podocin, are expressed in the nephrocyte and form a complex of interacting proteins that closely mirrors the vertebrate slit diaphragm complex.

These changes markedly impair filtration function in the nephrocyte.

Browne’s videos elicited gasps from the audience because comb jellies, whose lineage evolved long before other animals with through-guts, had been thought to eat and excrete through a single hole leading to a saclike gut (...) According to recent DNA analyses, comb jellies evolved earlier than other animals considered to have one hole, including sea anemones, jellyfish, and possibly sea sponges. (Some studies suggest sponges arose first.) Consequently, Browne’s as-yet unpublished findings disrupt the stepwise progression of digestive anatomy from one to two holes early in animal evolution. One possibility is that the comb jellies evolved through-guts and anuslike pores on their own, independent of all other animals, over hundreds of millions of years. Alternatively, a through-gut and exit hole may have evolved once in an ancient animal ancestor, and subsequently became lost in anemones, jellyfish, and sponges."	bgee	ANN	2016-04-25

However, the evolutionary history of vertebrate gills has been the subject of a long-standing controversy [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. It is thought that gills evolved independently in cyclostomes (jawless vertebrates-lampreys and hagfish) and gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates-cartilaginous and bony fishes), based on their distinct embryonic origins: the gills of cyclostomes derive from endoderm [9, 10, 11, 12], while gnathostome gills were classically thought to derive from ectoderm [10, 13]. Here, we demonstrate by cell lineage tracing that the gills of a cartilaginous fish, the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea), are in fact endodermally derived. This finding supports the homology of gills in cyclostomes and gnathostomes, and a single origin of pharyngeal gills prior to the divergence of these two ancient vertebrate lineages."	bgee	ANN	2017-02-13

It is therefore reasonable to suggest that the parathyroid gland evolved as a result of the transformation of the gills into the parathyroid glands of tetrapods and the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment. This interpretation would also explain the positioning of the parathyroid gland within the pharynx in the tetrapod body.

In the mouse it originates from cephalic paraxial mesoderm (Jiang et al., 2000; Morriss-Kay, 2001), whereas in chicken the parietal bone has been traced back to either mesodermal (Noden, 1978) or, according to improved methodological approach, to neural crest cells (Couly et al., 1992, 1993) (fig. 1). In the clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), the only other animal for which the embryonic origin of a membrane bone is currently known (Gross and Hanken, 2005), a single fronto-parietal bone also originates from neural crest cells, although a contribution from cranial paraxial mesodermal cells cannot be excluded, as these have not yet been fate-mapped.

(...)  here we find that mechanical induction of Y667/654 phosphorylation of beta-cat in early mesoderm determination is conserved in both species. This suggests that the mechanotransductive beta-cat pathway is more ancient than the protostome-specific or deuterostome-specific pathways previously identified in mesoderm induction, and dates back to the last common ancestor of zebrafish and Drosophila more than 570 million years ago, the period during which the mesoderm is thought to have emerged. A conserved mechanotransductive origin of the mesoderm specification in Bilateria embryos thus suggests that the mesoderm could have developed in diploblastic ancestors through the emergence of the mechanical control of the phosphorylation of the beta-cat Y667/654 site in response to gastrulation morphogenetic movements."	bgee	ANN	2014-01-13

From a comparative point of view, however, mesoderm has always been a puzzling aspect of bilaterian evolution, mainly because of the diversity of ways through which mesoderm originates during early development across, and even within, phyla. This has led many authors to argue that mesoderm would probably not be homologous across Bilateria."	bgee	ANN	2013-07-10

In contrast to mouse, Piwil4 is expressed in platypus and human adult testis. We found evidence for Mael and Piwil2 expression in mouse Sertoli cells. Importantly, we show mRNA expression of Piwil2, Piwil4, and Mael in oocytes and supporting cells of human, mouse, and platypus ovary. We found no Piwil1 expression in mouse and chicken ovary.

In invertebrates, the spaces are lined only by matrix. Vertebrates have evolved a secondary cell lining, termed endothelium. (...)The last common ancestor of vertebrates and annelids, or of vertebrates and mollusks was the ancestor of the protostome-deuterostome ancestor, which lived between 600 and 700 million years ago [59]. Although the fossil record is scarce, it is widely believed that this precursor animal was a segmented bilaterian (triploblastic coelomate) [9]. If we are to accept that the blood vascular system evolved as a means to bypass the bulkheads of a segmented animal (see next section), then the first such system likely arose during this time. Flow would have been mediated by peristaltic vessels, perhaps like those described in the annelid. Blood probably percolated through spaces in the extracellular matrix, and thus, the system was by definition closed, albeit primitive.

Nephrons were present at some time in all body segments, but later were restricted to the trunk region of the animal. A tendency for the most anterior tubules to develop and function in early life, and for the more posterior tubules to develop and function later in life led to the differentiation into pro-, meso-, and metanephros (Goodrich, 1958)."	bgee	ANN	2013-08-29

Avian and mammalian kidneys show a major modification to the basic structure of the nephron-Henle's loop-which enabled urine to be concentrated. Bird kidneys contain two types of nephrons: nephrons with Henle's loop ('mammalian type') and nephrons without Henle's loop ('reptilian type').

The evolutionary origin of this exoskeleton has long been attributed to the emergence of the neural crest, but experimental evaluation for this is still poor. Here we determine the embryonic origin of scales and fin rays of medaka (teleost trunk exoskeletons) by applying long-term cell labelling methods, and demonstrate that both tissues are mesodermal in origin. Neural crest cells, however, fail to contribute to these tissues. This result suggests that the trunk neural crest has no skeletogenic capability in fish, instead highlighting the dominant role of the mesoderm in the evolution of the trunk skeleton. This further implies that the role of the neural crest in skeletogenesis has been predominant in the cephalic region from the early stage of vertebrate evolution."	bgee	ANN	2013-08-12

It has been proposed that a penis is an amniote synapomorphy (Jones 1915; Gauthier et al. 1988). However, anatomical and developmental differences among penises in these groups (Kelly 2002) mapped on independent phylogenetic hypotheses of their relationships (Rieppel & deBraga 1996; Hedges & Poling 1999; Janke et al. 2001) strongly suggest that each penis-bearing group arose independently from ancestors that had internal fertilization without intromission (such as the cloacal apposition seen in Sphenodon (Romer 1970) and passerine birds (Birkhead et al. 1993))."	bgee	ANN	2013-08-30

Zoological Lett (2016)."	"the disposition of the lamprey EOMs [extra-ocular muscles] differs from those the rest of vertebrates, in which the morphological pattern of EOMs is strongly conserved. To better understand the evolution and developmental origins of the vertebrate EOMs, we explored the development of the head mesoderm and EOMs of the lamprey in detail. We found that the disposition of lamprey EOM primordia differed from that in gnathostomes, even during the earliest period of development. We also found that three components of the paraxial head mesoderm could be distinguished genetically (premandibular mesoderm: Gsc+/TbxA-; mandibular mesoderm: Gsc-/TbxA-; hyoid mesoderm: Gsc-/TbxA+), indicating that the genetic mechanisms of EOMs are conserved in all vertebrates. We conclude that the tripartite developmental origin of the EOMs is likely to have been possessed by the latest common ancestor of the vertebrates. This ancestor's EOM developmental pattern was also suggested to have resembled more that of the lamprey, and the gnathostome EOMs' disposition is likely to have been established by a secondary modification that took place in the common ancestor of crown gnathostomes."	bgee	ANN	2016-10-10

In this review, they are therefore referred to a common lipogenic class. These glands are exclusive of Amniota and perform similar functions to the syncytial lipid glands in phyllomedusine tree frogs, by providing a hydrophobic shield against terrestrial environs. They differ from the latter in that they are epithelial rather than syncytial in structure, undergo holocrine degeneration during lipogenesis and lack a myoepithelial sheath. Besides waterproofing the body surface and horny skin appendages (feathers and hairs), sebaceous units may play an accessory role as scent (odorous) glands, either as homogeneous secretory organs, or in association with apocrine sweat tubules (in mammals)."	bgee	ANN	2013-10-10

Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) are narrow-band sound signals emitted from the inner ear, and it is generally assumed that their energy derives from the hair-cell molecular motors underlying cochlear amplification. However, all terrestrial vertebrates studied so far (including amphibians) show very similar SOAEs.

They are inhibited during hypercapnia and by lung inflation. They can be abolished by baclofen. These properties are shared by ventilatory motor patterns of lower vertebrates, leading to the hypothesis that hiccough is the resurgence of archaic motor patterns and particularly of the motor pattern of gill ventilation in bimodal breathers such as most frogs, at the tadpole stage. A circuit that can generate hiccoughs may persist in mammals because it has permitted the development of pattern generators for other useful functions such as modern eupnea or suckling.

As discussed above, the earliest ancestral vertebrates are predicted to have produced only C27 bile alcohols as their major bile salts. The more difficult question is, when did the ability to synthesize C24 bile acids first appear. There are two main possibilities here. First, the last common ancestor to fish and mammals (basal gnathostome) already had the ability to synthesize C24 bile acids. In this case, the observation of extant gnathostomes (e.g., lobe-finned fish, salamanders, some frogs) that secrete only C27 bile alcohols would reflect lineage-specific loss of the ability to synthesize C24 bile acids during evolution. Alternatively, the basal gnathostome had only C27 bile alcohols and the ability to synthesize C24 bile acids has occurred multiple times in vertebrate evolution (i.e., convergent evolution)."	bgee	ANN	2017-10-10

It is noteworthy that the latter structures require specific expression of Pax6 in the rhombic lip of the gnathostome hindbrain. Interestingly, the lamprey rhombic lip does not express Pax6. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that in vertebrate evolution the rostral hindbrain is incapable of differentiating into the cerebellum before the co-option of Pax6 in that region. In other words, cerebellum has been brought about as an evolutionary innovation in gnathostomes, based on exaptation of MHB, rhombic lip, and some regulatory gene expression already present in the vertebrate common ancestor."	bgee	ANN	2013-06-11

Their loss or dislocation causes various forms of disequilibrium, including benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, the most common balance disorder in humans (Brandt 2001). The ear of actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) contains only three large otoliths - the lapillus in the utricle, the sagitta in the saccule, and the asteriscus in the lagena - each with a distinctive and species-specific shape (Nolf 1985). In contrast, the vestibular organs of sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes or higher vertebrates) hold innumerable small and barrel-shaped otoconia. Otoconial growth is completed during early postnatal stages, whereas otoliths continue to grow throughout life under the influence of circadian and seasonal rhythms; the resulting growth rings form a stable record of a fish's life history (Campana and Thorrold 2001)."	bgee	ANN	2017-05-02

In diagrams made from sectioned juveniles, researchers have described the formation of two distinct hollow tubes that fuse into a single tube [25]. An invagination along the dorsal surface of this tube gives rise to the myocardium while the outer surface differentiates as pericardium. Further studies are required to confirm these classic observations of post-larval cardiogenesis. If these observations prove accurate, they indicate that Ciona heart morphogenesis may exhibit some ancestral chordate characteristics. In Xenopus and the basal chordate amphioxus, the myocardium is also derived from a dorsal invagination [26, 27].

Nature (2006)"	"Conservation of the embryonic origin and the patterns of Hox and Tbx gene expression in shark and lamprey median fins suggests that the molecular mechanisms of fin development evolved in the midline before the origin of paired fins. Our finding that median fin mesenchyme arises predominantly from somites suggests that these cells may acquire their positional identities, in the form of Hox and Tbx expression, during regionalization of paraxial mesoderm. We suggest that the origin of paired appendages from lateral plate mesoderm involved re-deployment of mechanisms that were originally restricted to paraxial mesoderm, where they regulated development of cartilage (Hox9-Hox13, Tbx18), muscle (Pax7, Paraxis) and tendon (Scleraxis) in the axial skeleton and median fins. Reports of Msx and Dlx expression in paired and median fins of zebrafish (28, 29) may reflect additional evolutionary signatures of this co-option. It is possible that the mechanisms of fin and limb development were established in median finfolds even before the origin of vertebrates. Analysis of median finfold development in cephalochordates will further test the hypothesis that these mechanisms emerged early in chordate evolution."	bgee	ANN	2013-08-29

In hox13 knockout fish, we find that a marked reduction and loss of fin rays is associated with an increased number of endochondral distal radials.

In contrast, the echinoderms and hemichordates are sister groups of the chordates and they lack the notochord and paraxial mesoderm. Thus, the basic mesodermal organization of vertebrates must have appeared first in the common ancestor of the chordates."	bgee	ANN	2013-07-10

Semin Cell Dev Biol (2007)"	"It has recently become apparent that amniote (avian, reptilian and mammalian) hearts are constructed from at least two distinct fields [32]. The left ventricle and atrial chambers arise from a primary field. (...) The ancestral chordate heart has been proposed to be equivalent to the primary heart field with the resulting left ventricle representing the ancestral single chamber. Studies of primary heart field patterning indicate that the default fate of this lineage is ventricular and that the atrial fate is the result of secondary patterning events, including a critical role for RA [right atrium] signaling [33]. Thus the Ciona heart is probably homologous to the vertebrate left ventricular field."	bgee	ANN	2015-03-31

It is a feature of the evolutionary primitive state. In amphibians it is called the bulbus cordis, a term that is also used for its equivalent in mammalian embryos. The more derived extant bony fish, like the zebrafish, do not have this cardiac compartment. They have a so-called bulbus arteriosus, which is not enclosed by cardiac muscle, but by elastic tissue and smooth muscle, and therefore is considered to be a specialization of the proximal part of the ventral aorta. However, similar to the mammalian condition, the bulbus arteriosus in zebrafish embryonic hearts is surrounded by myocardium that disappears with development. The bony fish bulbus arteriosus might thus be homologous to the shark conus arteriosus and amphibian/mammalian bulbus cordis."	bgee	ANN	2015-04-01

(...) These basic relationships have not been modified by urodeles. The small pericardial cavity remains far forward where it is separated by a transverse septum from the principal coelom, which may now be called a pleuroperitoneal cavity because slender lungs are present. (...) The heart (of other tetrapods) is separated from the lungs (and liver if present) by more or less horizontal partitions that have their origin in the embryo as folds on the serous membrane of the right and left lateral body walls. These grow out to join in the midline of the body. They are called lateral mesocardia (birds) or pleuropericardial membranes. Posteriorly they join the transverse septum to form the adult pericardial membrane, or pericardium. (...) In their partitioning of their coelom, embryonic mammals resemble first early fishes (incomplete partition, posterior to heart, consisting of the transverse septum) and then reptiles (pericardium derived from transverse septum and pleuropericardial membranes). Mammals then separate paired pleural cavities from the peritoneal cavity by a diaphragm. The ventral portion of this organ comes from the transverse septum. The dorsal portion is derived from the dorsal mesentery and from still another pair of outgrowths from the lateral body wall, the pleuroperitoneal membranes."	bgee	ANN	2013-07-16

Nat Commun (2013)"	"The vertebrate mineralized skeleton is known to have first emerged as an exoskeleton that extensively covered the fossil jawless fish. The evolutionary origin of this exoskeleton has long been attributed to the emergence of the neural crest, but experimental evaluation for this is still poor. Here we determine the embryonic origin of scales and fin rays of medaka (teleost trunk exoskeletons) by applying long-term cell labelling methods, and demonstrate that both tissues are mesodermal in origin. Neural crest cells, however, fail to contribute to these tissues. This result suggests that the trunk neural crest has no skeletogenic capability in fish, instead highlighting the dominant role of the mesoderm in the evolution of the trunk skeleton. This further implies that the role of the neural crest in skeletogenesis has been predominant in the cephalic region from the early stage of vertebrate evolution."	bgee	ANN	2013-08-12

Two main historical hypotheses have been proposed to explain its absence from most living tetrapods: first, the cleithrum was lost in common tetrapod (stem-group) ancestors and re-acquired only in frogs; second, it was independently lost from the lineages leading to living salamanders, diapsids, turtles and mammals."	bgee	ANN	2015-03-31

Nature (2015)"	"In the 1990s, advances in developmental genetics - again with arthropods leading the way - set the stage for the revival of the annelid theory. The fly dpp gene was found to be expressed dorsally and to have dorsalizing activity, whereas the homologous frog bmp4 was expressed ventrally and found to have ventralizing activity. Arendt and Nuebler-Jung interpreted this pattern as support for homology between arthropod and vertebrate nerve cords and indicative of a dorsoventral inversion of the body during the invertebrate-to-vertebrate transition. The proposed nerve-cord homology was strengthened by the discovery that the fly sog gene was expressed ventrally and had ventralizing activity, whereas the homologous frog chordin gene was expressed dorsally and had dorsalizing activity. In addition, sog/chordin and dpp/bmp4 antagonized one another to establish a dorsoventral axis that was reversed between flies and frogs. Additional support came from the finding that neural progenitor cells in the central nervous system (CNS) were organized in longitudinal bands each characterized by a distinctive suite of gene expression that was homologous between flies and vertebrates, and that gene expression in these bands was comparable mediolaterally in both organisms."	bgee	ANN	2015-04-30

The dorsal hollow neural tube and the mouth have often been thought of as developmentally distinct structures that may have followed independent evolutionary paths. In most chordates however, including vertebrates and ascidians, the mouth primordia have been shown to fate to the anterior neural boundary. In ascidians such as Ciona there is a particularly intimate relationship between brain and mouth development, with a thin canal connecting the neural tube lumen to the mouth primordium at larval stages. This so-called neurohypophyseal canal was previously thought to be a secondary connection that formed relatively late, after the independent formation of the mouth primordium and the neural tube. Here we show that the Ciona neurohypophyseal canal is present from the end of neurulation and represents the anteriormost neural tube, and that the future mouth opening is actually derived from the anterior neuropore."	bgee	ANN	2013-09-24

Dev Genes Evol (2000)"	"To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation and function of the endostyle, with special reference to the evolution of the follicle of the thyroid gland, I isolated and characterized cDNA clones for the amphioxus homologs of the TTF-1 gene (BbTTF-1) and TPO gene (BbTPO) from Branchiostoma belcheri. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction/Southern blotting revealed that both amphioxus TTF-1 and TPO genes are expressed mainly in the adult endostyle. Spatial and temporal expression patterns assessed by in situ hybridization revealed that BbTTF-1 is expressed in the endodermal cells during early embryogenesis and is maintained in all zones of the adult endostyle. On the other hand, expression of BbTPO is chiefly in zones 5 and 6 of the adult endostyle where it overlaps with that of BbTTF-1, and to a lesser extent in zones 1 and 3. This restriction of the expression of BbTTF-1 and BbTPO to the endostyle strongly suggests that the endostyle is homologous to the follicle of the thyroid gland. Moreover, the spatial and temporal expression patterns of these genes suggest that TTF-1 regulates TPO expression. The coexpression of these genes in amphioxus suggests that regulation of TPO by TTF-1 was present in the common ancestor of cephalochordates (acraniates) and craniates."	bgee	ANN	2017-05-01

EMBO Rep (2017)"	"An old question about regeneration is whether it is an ancestral character which is a general property of living matter, or whether it represents a set of specific adaptations to the different circumstances faced by different types of animal. In this review, some recent results on regeneration are assessed to see if they can throw any new light on this question. Evidence in favour of an ancestral character comes from the role of Wnt and bone morphogenetic protein signalling in controlling the pattern of whole-body regeneration in acoels, which are a basal group of bilaterian animals. On the other hand, there is some evidence for adaptive acquisition or maintenance of the regeneration of appendages based on the occurrence of severe non-lethal predation, the existence of some novel genes in regenerating organisms, and differences at the molecular level between apparently similar forms of regeneration. It is tentatively concluded that whole-body regeneration is an ancestral character although has been lost from most animal lineages. Appendage regeneration is more likely to represent a derived character resulting from many specific adaptations."	bgee	ANN	2017-10-10

Thus, a comparable molecular mechanism for distinguishing non-neural ectoderm from neural ectoderm was probably present in the common ancestor of all bilaterally symmetrical animals."	bgee	ANN	2013-07-10

Ectodermal thickenings derived from this domain express placodal regulatory genes, including Six3/6, Pitx and Eya. For example, the atrial siphon placode shares extensive similarities with the vertebrate otic placode (Fig. 4), whereas the stomodeum (the oral siphon primordium) expresses regulatory genes implicated in the specification of the vertebrate olfactory and adenohypophyseal placodes, including Six, Eya and the anterior placode markers Pitx and Dlx. These new findings argue for homologies between urochordate siphon primordia and vertebrate placodes and suggest that; although certain placodes (profundal, maxillomandibular, epibranchial and lens) evolved by diversification within the vertebrate lineage, others (adenohypophyseal, olfactory and otic) appeared before the separation of vertebrates and urochordates (Figs 3, 4)."	bgee	ANN	2016-09-05

(...) These basic relationships have not been modified by urodeles. The small pericardial cavity remains far forward where it is separated by a transverse septum from the principal coelom, which may now be called a pleuroperitoneal cavity because slender lungs are present. (...) In their partitioning of their coelom, embryonic mammals resemble first early fishes (incomplete partition, posterior to heart, consisting of the transverse septum) and then reptiles (pericardium derived from transverse septum and pleuropericardial membranes). Mammals then separate paired pleural cavities from the peritoneal cavity by a diaphragm. The ventral portion of this organ comes from the transverse septum. The dorsal portion is derived from the dorsal mesentery and from still another pair of outgrowths from the lateral body wall, the pleuroperitoneal membranes."	bgee	ANN	2013-09-24

The dorsal hollow neural tube and the mouth have often been thought of as developmentally distinct structures that may have followed independent evolutionary paths. In most chordates however, including vertebrates and ascidians, the mouth primordia have been shown to fate to the anterior neural boundary. In ascidians such as Ciona there is a particularly intimate relationship between brain and mouth development, with a thin canal connecting the neural tube lumen to the mouth primordium at larval stages. This so-called neurohypophyseal canal was previously thought to be a secondary connection that formed relatively late, after the independent formation of the mouth primordium and the neural tube. Here we show that the Ciona neurohypophyseal canal is present from the end of neurulation and represents the anteriormost neural tube, and that the future mouth opening is actually derived from the anterior neuropore."	bgee	ANN	2013-09-24

Ectodermal thickenings derived from this domain express placodal regulatory genes, including Six3/6, Pitx and Eya. For example, the atrial siphon placode shares extensive similarities with the vertebrate otic placode (Fig. 4), whereas the stomodeum (the oral siphon primordium) expresses regulatory genes implicated in the specification of the vertebrate olfactory and adenohypophyseal placodes, including Six, Eya and the anterior placode markers Pitx and Dlx. These new findings argue for homologies between urochordate siphon primordia and vertebrate placodes and suggest that; although certain placodes (profundal, maxillomandibular, epibranchial and lens) evolved by diversification within the vertebrate lineage, others (adenohypophyseal, olfactory and otic) appeared before the separation of vertebrates and urochordates (Figs 3, 4)."	bgee	ANN	2015-05-01

Second, and more importantly, it is cladistically more parsimonious to consider that these muscles were independently acquired in actinistians and halecostomes (2 steps) than to have one acquisition (in the node leading to osteichthyans) and various independent losses (at least in non-actinistian sarcopterygians, in cladistians, in chondrosteans and in ginglymodians) (see Fig. 1).

In contrast to earlier literature, we find that a duct always persists to connect the endostyle lumen to the pharynx, a structure that resembles the thyroglossal duct in thyroid development and could further support the homology between endostyle and thyroid."	bgee	ANN	2015-03-31

A number of investigators of the comparative anatomy of the cerebellum now regard avian and mammalian cerebella as having a very similar organization; therefore, if the term 'neocerebellum' has any utility at all, it should be appied both to birds and mammals."	bgee	ANN	2017-09-26

In addition, the mammalian cerebellum shows a large, highly foliated, lateral expansion known as the neocerebellum. Similar patterns may be seen in the cerebella of cartilaginous fishes, amphibians, and reptiles. In birds, the corpus cerebelli becomes foliated into 10 folia. Whether the lateral expansion in mammals is in fact 'new' or is merely a variation on the same foliated plan as seen in birds is a matter now being debated. Evidence does exist, however, to suggest that, rather than being a new addition to the cerebellum, the neocerebellum is, in fact, merely a lateral expansion of the corpus cerebelli."	bgee	ANN	2017-09-26

Nature (2006)"	"Conservation of the embryonic origin and the patterns of Hox and Tbx gene expression in shark and lamprey median fins suggests that the molecular mechanisms of fin development evolved in the midline before the origin of paired fins. Our finding that median fin mesenchyme arises predominantly from somites suggests that these cells may acquire their positional identities, in the form of Hox and Tbx expression, during regionalization of paraxial mesoderm. We suggest that the origin of paired appendages from lateral plate mesoderm involved re-deployment of mechanisms that were originally restricted to paraxial mesoderm, where they regulated development of cartilage (Hox9-Hox13, Tbx18), muscle (Pax7, Paraxis) and tendon (Scleraxis) in the axial skeleton and median fins. Reports of Msx and Dlx expression in paired and median fins of zebrafish (28, 29) may reflect additional evolutionary signatures of this co-option. It is possible that the mechanisms of fin and limb development were established in median finfolds even before the origin of vertebrates. Analysis of median finfold development in cephalochordates will further test the hypothesis that these mechanisms emerged early in chordate evolution."	bgee	ANN	2015-04-01

Nature (2010)"	"The altered expression of genes involved in anteroposterior patterning of the limb following impaired function of and1 and and2 and actinotrichia formation allows us to propose hypotheses regarding appendage evolution. The reduced growth of morphant pectoral fins and their defective fold suggest that the resulting adult fins would be shorter and distally truncated. Notably, formation of the lepidotrichia, the dermal bony rays, seems to be compromised, as suggested by the absence of migration of mesenchymal cells (which include progenitors of lepidotrichia-forming cells) in the distal portion of the morphant pectoral fins (Fig. 3g, h). If our observations in zebrafish apply to an ancestral fish, it is tempting to propose that, during evolution, the loss of the actinotrichia in an ancestral fish may have contributed to the concurrent loss of the lepidotrichia. However, this consequence may apply uniquely to the pectoral fins as the effects of the loss of function of and1 and and2 in zebrafish seem to be less drastic in the tail, and lepidotrichia may develop normally (Fig. 3). This hypothesis fits with fossil records showing that the earliest primitive aquatic tetrapods of the late-Devonian period had lost lepidotrichia in paired appendages but still retained a ‘fish tail’ with lepidotrichia27."	bgee	ANN	2018-03-26

Gene expression analyses revealed that the ventromedially positioned ventral habenula in the adult originated from the region of primordium lateral to the dorsal habenula during development. This suggested that zebrafish habenulae emerge during development with mediolateral orientation similar to that of the mammalian medial and lateral habenulae. These findings indicated that the lateral habenular pathways are evolutionarily conserved pathways and might control adaptive behaviors in vertebrates through the regulation of monoaminergic activities."	bgee	ANN	2015-04-14
