6239	5	3	4	Left	2	Left	Removed all intergenic with TPM > max(intergenic_2). needs to be confirmed because not a lot of intergenic remaining. Will keep lots of coding below log2(TPM) = 0. If choose 3 Left not of intergenic remains. Hard choice?..	JW

10090	5	3			3	Left	Removed all intergenic with TPM > max(intergenic_3). Annotation from Bgee 14 said : Removed right-most intergenic gaussian (3 and right part of 1), because proportion of coding expressed was a little bit too low.	JW

69293	3	2			1	Left	Removed all intergenic with TPM > max(intergenic_1). Could have chosen 2 Right to keep  TPM < min(intergenic_2). Looks like there is a problem in genome annotation (lack of gene annotation?)	JW
