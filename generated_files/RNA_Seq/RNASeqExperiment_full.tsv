"GSE30352"	"The evolution of gene expression levels in mammalian organs"	"Changes in gene expression are thought to underlie many of the phenotypic differences between species. However, large-scale analyses of gene expression evolution were until recently prevented by technological limitations. Here we report the sequencing of polyadenylated RNA from six organs across ten species that represent all major mammalian lineages (placentals, marsupials and monotremes) and birds (the evolutionary outgroup), with the goal of understanding the dynamics of mammalian transcriptome evolution. We show that the rate of gene expression evolution varies among organs, lineages and chromosomes, owing to differences in selective pressures: transcriptome change was slow in nervous tissues and rapid in testes, slower in rodents than in apes and monotremes, and rapid for the X chromosome right after its formation. Although gene expression evolution in mammals was strongly shaped by purifying selection, we identify numerous potentially selectively driven expression switches, which occurred at different rates across lineages and tissues and which probably contributed to the specific organ biology of various mammals. Our transcriptome data provide a valuable resource for functional and evolutionary analyses of mammalian genomes."	"GEO"	"total"

"GSE41338"	"The evolutionary landscape of alternative splicing in vertebrate species"	"How species with similar repertoires of protein coding genes differ so dramatically at the phenotypic level is poorly understood. From comparing the transcriptomes of multiple organs from vertebrate species spanning ~350 million years of evolution, we observe significant differences in alternative splicing complexity between the main vertebrate lineages, with the highest complexity in the primate lineage. Moreover, within as little as six million years, the splicing profiles of physiologically-equivalent organs have diverged to the extent that they are more strongly related to the identity of a species than they are to organ type. Most vertebrate species-specific splicing patterns are governed by the highly variable use of a largely conserved cis-regulatory code. However, a smaller number of pronounced species-dependent splicing changes are predicted to remodel interactions involving factors acting at multiple steps in gene regulation. These events are expected to further contribute to the dramatic diversification of alternative splicing as well as to other gene regulatory changes that contribute to phenotypic differences among vertebrate species."

To assess tissue-specific transcriptome variation across mammals, we sequenced cDNA from 9 tissues from 4 mammals and one bird in biological triplicate, at unprecedented depth. We find that while tissue-specific gene expression programs are largely conserved, alternative splicing is well conserved in only a subset of tissues and is frequently lineage-specific. Thousands of novel, lineage-specific and conserved alternative exons were identified; widely conserved alternative exons had signatures of binding by MBNL, PTB, RBFOX, STAR and TIA family splicing factors, implicating them as ancestral mammalian splicing regulators. Our data also indicates that alternative splicing is often used to alter protein phosphorylatability, delimiting the scope of kinase signaling."	"GEO"	"total"									"SRP016501, PRJNA177791"

"GSE43721"	"Cellular source and mechanisms of high transcriptome complexity in the mammalian testis (RNA-Seq organs)"	"Understanding the extent of genomic transcription and its functional relevance is a central goal in genomics research. However, detailed genome-wide investigations of transcriptome complexities in major mammalian organs and their underlying cellular sources, transcriptional mechanisms, and functional relevance have been scarce. Here we first show, using extensive RNA-seq data, that transcription of both functional and nonfunctional genomic elements is substantially more widespread in the testis than in other organs across representative mammals. By scrutinizing the transcriptomes of all main testicular cell types in the mouse, we then reveal that meiotic spermatocytes and especially post-meiotic round spermatids have remarkably diverse transcriptomes, which explains the high transcriptome complexity of the testis as a whole. The widespread transcriptional activity in spermatocytes and spermatids encompasses protein-coding genes and long noncoding RNA genes but also poorly conserved intergenic sequences, suggesting that much of it is not of immediate functional relevance. Rather, our analyses of genome-wide epigenetic data show that this prevalent transcription, which apparently promoted the birth of new genes during evolution, results from a highly permissive chromatin state during and after meiosis that may ultimately facilitate the replacement of histones by protamines during late spermatogenesis."

"GSE71681"	"Yap and Taz regulate retinal pigment epithelial cell fate"	"The optic vesicle comprises a pool of bi-potential progenitor cells from which the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and neural retina fates segregate during ocular morphogenesis. Several transcription factors and signaling pathways have been shown to be important for RPE maintenance and differentiation, but an understanding of the initial fate specification and determination of this ocular cell type is lacking. We show that Yap/Taz-Tead activity is necessary and sufficient for optic vesicle progenitors to adopt RPE identity in zebrafish. A Teadresponsive transgene is expressed within the domain of the optic cup from which RPE arises, and Yap immunoreactivity localizes to the nuclei of prospective RPE cells. yap (yap1) mutants lack a subset of RPE cells and/or exhibit coloboma. Loss of RPE in yap mutants is exacerbated in combination with taz (wwtr1) mutant alleles such that, when Yap and Taz are both absent, optic vesicle progenitor cells completely lose their ability to form RPE. The mechanism of Yap dependent RPE cell type determination is reliant on both nuclear localization of Yap and interaction with a Tead co-factor. In contrast to loss of Yap and Taz, overexpression of either protein within optic vesicle progenitors leads to ectopic pigmentation in a dosagedependent manner. Overall, this study identifies Yap and Taz as key early regulators of RPE genesis and provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the congenital ocular defects of Sveinsson's chorioretinal atrophy and congenital retinal coloboma."

However, some transcribed elements may not be functional, and technical artifacts may lead to erroneous inference of transcription. Inter-species comparison provides confidence to predicted annotation, since transcriptional activity that has been evolutionarily conserved is likely to have an advantageous function. We have performed RNA-Seq and CAGE-Seq experiments on more than 80 samples from multiple tissues and stages of 15 Drosophila species, including 8 previously unsequenced genomes. We have found strikingly conserved sequence, expression, and splicing for the vast majority of transcript models in modENCODE annotation (e.g. 99% exons of coding sequences (CDS), 88% exons of untranslated regions (UTR), and 87% splicing events), indicating that the transcriptome annotation is of very high quality. We also describe dynamic transcriptome evolution within the Drosophila genus, including conserved promoter structure, labile positions of transcription start sites, and rapidly evolving RNA-editing events. We demonstrate how this phylogenetic approach to DNA element validation will prove useful in the annotation of other high priority genomes, especially for genomes that are less compact than Drosophila (e.g. the vast majority of vertebrate genomes)."

"#GSE38397"	"Comparative oncogenomic analysis of copy number alterations in human and zebrafish tumors enables cancer driver discovery"	"The identification of cancer drivers is a major goal of current cancer research. Finding driver genes within large chromosomal events is especially challenging because such alterations encompass many genes. Previously, we demonstrated that zebrafish malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aneuploid, much like human tumors. In this study, we examined 147 zebrafish MPNSTs by massively parallel sequencing and identified both large and focal copy number alterations (CNAs). Given the low degree of conserved synteny between fish and mammals, we reasoned that comparative analyses of CNAs from fish versus human MPNSTs would enable elimination of a large proportion of passenger mutations, especially on large CNAs. Accordingly, we found less than one third of the human CNA genes were co-gained or co-lost in zebrafish, dramatically narrowing the list of candidate cancer drivers for both focal and large CNAs. We conclude that zebrafish-human comparative analysis represents a powerful, and broadly applicable, tool to enrich for evolutionarily conserved cancer drivers. --- This filing comprises data related to GEO entry GSE23666 (*Highly Aneuploid Zebrafish Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors have Genetic Alterations Similar to Human Cancers*), representing a followup study."

Specifically, we link increases in cellular apoptosis and TGF-BR2 signalling to MC breakdown in opossums. We demonstrate that a simple change in TGF-b signalling is sufficient to inhibit MC breakdown during opossum development, indicating that changes in TGF-b signalling might be key during mammalian evolution. Furthermore, the apoptosis that we observe during opossum MC breakdown does not seemingly occur in mouse, consistent with homoplastic DMME evolution in the marsupial and placental lineages."

Salmonids contribute to local and global economies through aquaculture, wild stock fisheries and recreational sport fisheries. In addition, they are a traditional food source for aboriginal peoples and play a central role in their culture. Salmon and trout are sentinel species for monitoring the aquatic environment, and therefore they are used extensively for eco-toxicology studies. Importantly, the common ancestor of salmon and trout experienced a whole genome duplication (60-100MYA), and modern species may be considered pseudo tetraploid as they are well along the process of reverting to a stable diploid state. There is a large salmonid research community working on the biology, life histories, population dynamics, biogeography, phylogenetic relationships, physiology and nutrition of salmonids. No other species group of fishes receives such comprehensive commercial and scientific attention. p An International Collaboration to Sequence the Atlantic Salmon Genome (ICSASG), representing researchers, funding agencies and industry from Canada, Chile and Norway, was formed to undertake a comprehensive genome sequence that would benefit all salmonids. p Note: Double haploid individual chosen for sequencing"	"SRA"	"partial"	"Atlantic salmon (derived from one of the 3 first given ENA data)"	31				"PRJNA72713"	27088604	"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8127823/pdf/41586_2016_Article_BFnature17164.pdf"

"#SRP002394"	"An Atlas of Bovine Gene Expression Reveals Novel Distinctive Tissue Characteristics and Evidence for Improving Genome Annotation"	"Background: A comprehensive transcriptome survey, or *gene atlas*, provides information essential for a complete understanding of the genomic biology of an organism. We present an atlas of RNA abundance for 92 adult, juvenile and fetal cattle tissues and 3 cattle cell lines. Results: The Bovine Gene Atlas was generated from 7.2 million unique digital gene expression tag sequences (300.2 million total raw tag sequences), from which 1.59 million unique tag sequences were identified that mapped to the bovine genome accounting for 85% of the total raw tag abundance. Filtering these tags yielded 87,764 unique tag sequences that unambiguously mapped to 16,517 annotated protein-coding loci in the genome accounting for 45% of the total raw tag abundance. Clustering of tissues based on tag abundance profiles generally confirmed ontology classification based on anatomy. There were 5,429 constitutively expressed loci and 3,445 constitutively expressed unique tag sequences mapping outside annotated gene boundaries that represent a resource for enhancing current gene models. Physical measures such as inferred transcript length or antisense tag abundance identified tissues with atypical transcriptional tag profiles. We report for the first time the tissue specific variation in the proportion of mitochondrial transcriptional tag abundance. The Bovine Gene Atlas can be examined at http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/bovineatlas . Conclusions: The Bovine Gene Atlas is the deepest and broadest transcriptome survey of any livestock genome to date. Commonalities and variation in sense and antisense transcript tag profiles identified in different tissues facilitate the examination of the relationship between gene expression, tissue, and gene function.

Surprisingly, over half of euchromatic TEs show spread of repressive epigenetic marks to nearby DNA, resulting in differential epigenetic states of homologous genic alleles and, in return, selection against TEs. Interestingly, compared to D. melanogaster, the lower TE content in D. simulans is correlated with stronger epigenetic effects of TEs and higher levels of host genetic factors known to promote epigenetic silencing. We conclude that the epigenetic effects of euchromatic TEs, and host genetic factors modulating such effects, play a critical role in the population dynamics of TEs within and between species.

These retinal defects can potentially be determined by gene-expression profiling of the whole retina. In this study, we measured the gene-expression profile of retinas microdissected from a zebrafish pde6cw59 (pde6c) mutant. Its retinas display not only photoreceptor degeneration but also issues in other cell types starting from 4 days postfertilization (dpf). To capture these initial changes, we subjected pde6c and wild-type (WT) retinas at 5 dpf to RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The sequencing analyses indicate that the RNA-Seq dataset was of high quality. We also validated the RNA-Seq results by Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) of seven phototransduction genes. We found that the fold changes of these genes measured by RT-qPCR highly correlated to those measured by RNA-Seq.

"SRP094623"	"Anguilla anguilla Transcriptome or Gene expression"	"Understanding the mechanisms underlying morphological/phenotypic dimorphism and plasticity, including the genomic basis and links to ecological influences, remains one of the major challenges in evolutionary biology. One prime example of phenotypically plastic species distributed along various environmental gradients is the European eel, Anguilla anguilla. At the juvenile (yellow eel) stage of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla), two morphotypes are found: broad- and narrow-heads. This dimorphism has been linked to dietary differences, with broad-heads feeding on harder and larger prey than narrow-heads. However, recent research showed that both morphotypes could already be distinguished at the glass eel stage, the non-feeding predecessor of the yellow eel stage, implying that factors other than trophic segregation play a role in the development of this head shape dimorphism. Here, we used gene transcription profiling (RNAseq) to identify significantly differential expressed genes between broad- and narrow-headed glass eels. Identification of these genes would strongly increase our understanding of the mechanism behind this dimorphism and its ecological implications. We found 260 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between the morphotypes, of which most were related to defense and immune responses. Interestingly, two genes involved in growth (soma and igf2) were significantly up-regulated in narrow-heads, while also nine genes involved in chemotaxis showed a significant differential expression. As such, we found support for the observation that head shape is also associated with somatic growth, with fast-growing eels developing a narrower head. Additionally, observations in the wild have shown that slow-growers prefer freshwater, while fast-growers prefer brackish water. The differential expression of genes involved in chemotaxis indeed seems to indicate that glass eel growth rate and habitat choice are related to each other. We hence hypothesize that two levels of segregations could take place in the European eel: first according to habitat choice, secondly according to feeding preference."

We identified 10,813 lncRNAs in Sus scrofa, of which 9,075 are novel. 57% of these lncRNAs were conserved in both human and mouse. These conserved lncRNAs tend to be more tissue-specific than pig-specific lncRNAs, and enriched in reproducible organs (i.e. testis and ovary).

One such lncRNA, a homolog of maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), was specifically expressed in the skeletal muscle at early developmental stage. And its expression pattern is conserved in pig and mouse.

"SRP009426"	"Comprehensive identification of long non-coding RNAs expressed during zebrafish embryogenesis [RNA_seq]"	"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a diverse class of transcripts that structurally resemble mRNAs but do not encode proteins. Recent genome-wide studies in human and mouse have annotated lncRNAs expressed in cell lines and adult tissues, but a systematic analysis of lncRNAs expressed during vertebrate embryogenesis has been elusive. To identify lncRNAs with potential functions in vertebrate embryogenesis, we performed a time series of RNA-Seq experiments at eight stages during early zebrafish development. We reconstructed 56,535 high-confidence transcripts in 28,912 loci, recovering the vast majority of expressed RefSeq transcripts, while identifying thousands of novel isoforms and expressed loci. We defined a stringent set of 1,133 non-coding multi-exonic transcripts expressed during embryogenesis. These include long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs), intronic overlapping lncRNAs, exonic antisense overlapping lncRNAs, and precursors for small RNAs (sRNAs). Zebrafish lncRNAs share many of the characteristics of their mammalian counterparts: relatively short length, low exon number, low expression, and conservation levels comparable to introns. Subsets of lncRNAs carry chromatin signatures characteristic of genes with developmental functions. The temporal expression profile of lncRNAs revealed two novel properties: lncRNAs are expressed in narrower time windows than protein-coding genes and are specifically enriched in early-stage embryos. In addition, several lncRNAs show tissue-specific expression and distinct subcellular localization patterns. Integrative computational analyses associated individual lncRNAs with specific pathways and functions, ranging from cell cycle regulation to morphogenesis. Our study provides the first comprehensive identification of lncRNAs in a vertebrate embryo and forms the foundation for future genetic, genomic and evolutionary studies.

"SRP012154"	"Next generation sequencing reveals differentially expressed genes associated with development of PSE turkey meat."	"The success of turkey breeding for rapid growth rate and larger breast size has coincided with an increasing incidence of a meat quality defect described as pale, soft and exudative (PSE). We hypothesized that this defect, which is associated with an abnormally rapid rate of postmortem metabolism, derives from altered expression of genes involved in metabolic regulation. Our objective was to use deep transcriptome RNA sequence analysis (RNAseq) to identify differentially expressed genes between normal and PSE turkey breasts. Following harvest of turkey breasts (n = 43), the pH at 15 min post-slaughter and percent marinade uptake at 24h post-slaughter were determined. Breast samples were classified as normal or PSE based on marinade uptake (high = normal; low = PSE). Total RNA from samples with the highest (n=4) and lowest (n=4) marinade uptake were isolated and sequenced using the Illumina GAIIX platform. Of 21,340 gene loci discovered by RNAseq, 8480 loci completely matched the turkey reference genome, and 480 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate, FDR<0.05) between normal and PSE samples. Two highlights were the genes nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV), upregulated about 38-fold and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4), downregulated 14-fold in PSE samples. Pathway analysis suggested that several biological functions, including carbohydrate metabolism and energy production, were affected by meat quality. Because PDK4 regulates conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, differences in regulation of oxidative metabolism may exist among turkeys. Accelerated early postmortem metabolism would result in faster pH decline in PSE meat. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that decreased expression of PDK4 was associated with lower pH in PSE samples (pH[PSE] = 5.59+/-0.09, pH[normal] = 5.77+/-0.17). The RNAseq results provided a greater molecular mechanistic understanding of development of PSE turkey, which will be a foundation for new intervention strategies to prevent development of this defect. Overall design: The mRNA profiles of normal and PSE turkey breast muscle were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx platform. Multiplexing was performed (2 samples/lane). Afterwards, difference in gene expression between normal and PSE samples were tested."	"SRA"	"partial"									"GSE37176, PRJNA158613"

We confirmed that the specific tRNA genes bound by pol III, as well as the extent and stability of binding, can vary substantially among mammalian tissues, and we discovered that this divergence is far greater between species. We combined pol III occupancy from genomically discrete tRNA loci into collective binding into isoacceptor classes and then into amino acid-based isotype classes, and at each step we found increasing conservation. At the level of amino acid isotypes, pol III binding is almost invariant among all the tissues and species profiled.

We investigated three male mixed-breed dogs with an ectodermal dysplasia phenotype characterized by marked hypotrichosis, absence of sweat glands and altered dentition with missing and abnormally shaped teeth. Analysis of whole genome sequence data from the three affected dogs and 281 control dogs revealed that the affected dogs shared the same haplotype on a large segment of the X-chromosome, whereas they did not share any large homozygous segments elsewhere in the genome. Unexpectedly, bioinformatic analysis of the sequence data did not reveal any private non-synonymous variant in the affected dogs within the shared haplotype on the X chromosome. Furthermore, no private DNA variants were found in the EDA gene. We therefore performed an RNA-seq experiment on skin biopsies to search for changes in the transcriptome. This analysis revealed that the EDA transcript in the affected dogs lacked 103 nucleotides encoded by exon 2. We speculate that this exon skipping is caused by a genetic variant located in one of the large introns flanking this exon, which was missed by whole genome sequencing with the illumina short read technology. The altered EDA transcript splicing most likely causes the observed XLHED in the affected dogs.

Out of 15 transcripts selected for RT-qPCR validation, we confirmed 13. In addition, serum samples were collected for metabolomic evaluation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was significantly up-regulated in both LV and MV while the level of circulating asymmetrical dimethyl arginine (ADMA), an endogenous NOS inhibitor, was lower in DMVD. Expressions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their endogenous inhibitor tissue inhibitor of matrix metallopeptidases (TIMP) were altered. This study demonstrates transcript and metabolite differences consistent with increased nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, impaired fatty acid transport and oxidation, and increased glucose uptake and glycolysis in DMVD. Our findings are consistent with metabolic conversion in the DMVD heart from oxidative metabolism to glycolysis along with an increased concentration of NO and ROS activity suggesting an alternative signaling effect. Alterations of redox-sensitive NO signaling may play a role in ECM (ECM) homeostasis via modulating MMP and TIMP expression. Overall design: mRNA profiles of both left ventricle and mitral valve tissues from dogs with DMVD and healthy controls were generated by deep sequencing approach using Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform."

"SRP055477"	"Transcriptome comparison between Beagle dogs and Chinese Field dogs after chronic stress exposure in the pituitary-adrenal axis"	"Purpose: The transcriptome profiles were compared among groups of chronic stress exposure and control in two different breeds to identify genes and pathways related to response to chronic stress in the pituitary-adrenal axis. Methods: 6 male adult CFD and 6 Beagles were chosen at random with the similarities in good health, weight and other aspects. Separately, 3 of these two breeds were freely selected for the stress exposure via intermittent electrical stimulation and restraint stress, while the other 3 of these two breeds were non-disposed for normal control.The details for the disposal of dogs were: every morning dogs were restrained and electrical stimulations were exerted with a stable current of 10 mA for 6 s and then with a 6 s interval, lasting for 20 min every day. The duration of disposal was ten days.ll 12 dogs were killed by air embolism in the 11th day. Subsequently, pituitary and adrenal cortex tissues were fast collected and isolated for further high-sequencing. Results: 8 cDNA libraries were constructed for RNA-seq. A number of reads ranging from 53,295,978 to 65,414,932 was obtained in those 8 groups. About 10,000 genes and transcripts were annotated in each group. Besides,A total of 40, 346, 376, 69, 70, 38, 57, and 71 DEGs were detected in the contrasts of BP1_vs_BP2, CFDP1_vs_CFDP2, BP1_vs_CFDP1, BP2_vs_CFDP2, BAC1_vs_BAC2, CFDAC1_vs_CFDAC2, BAC1_vs_CFDAC1, and BAC2_vs_CFDAC2, respectively. Conclusions: Our results can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding about the genetic mechanisms of response to chronic stress in adrenal cortex and pituitary.

In order to identify somatic drivers of canine InvTCC, the complete transcriptome for four tumors and two normal bladders was determined by RNAseq. All tumors harbored a somatic mutation that is homologous to the human BRAF(V600E) mutation, and an identical mutation was present in 87% of canine InvTCC tumors. The mutation was also detectable in the urine sediments of all dogs tested with mutation-positive tumors. Functional experiments suggest that, like human tumors, canine activating BRAF mutations potently stimulate the MAPK pathway.

The dwarf phenotype is expressed in heterozygous individuals and rabbits from dwarf breeds homozygous for the wild-type allele are normal rabbits (although smaller when compared to other breeds). Here, we show that the dwarf phenotype is caused by a ~12.1 kb deletion overlapping the promoter region and the first three exons of the HMGA2 gene, leading to gene inactivation.

Among those freshwater habitats, adjacent lake and river populations harbour distinct parasite communities, a recurring ecological difference proposed to drive adaptive differentiation between lake and river stickleback ecotypes. To study the rapid adaptation of sticklebacks to lake and river habitats, we analysed gene expression profiles of 77 whole-transcriptome libraries of two immune-relevant tissues, the head kidney and the spleen, obtained from wild-caught sticklebacks of the two habitat types across multiple geographic locations. Differential expression analyses identified 189 genes showing statistically significant habitat-specific expression patterns among the three European locations. Among those genes, 15 genes are annotated with putative immune functions, and 50 have been experimentally associated with immune-responses in sticklebacks, reinforcing the hypothesis that parasites contribute to adaptive evolution of lake and river sticklebacks.

The extent to which these processes are conserved is unclear, and little is known about methylation outside of mammals, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Neurospora crassa. Utilizing deep bisulfite sequencing, we have quantified DNA methylation in five plant, seven animal, and five fungal genomes. We find that gene body methylation is conserved between plants and animals, whereas selective methylation of transposons has evolved independently in the vertebrate lineage. We show that methylation of plant transposons in the CHG context extends to green algae, and present evidence for RNA-directed DNA methylation of fungal genes. We also show that antagonism between DNA methylation and histone H2A.Z is conserved between plants and animals. Our data demonstrate that extant DNA methylation systems are mosaics of conserved and derived features, and indicate that gene body methylation is an ancient property of eukaryotic genomes.

Here we report a mutation in LTBP2 that causes primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) in domestic cats. We identified a spontaneous form of PCG in cats and established a breeding colony segregating for PCG consistent with fully penetrant, autosomal recessive inheritance of the trait. Elevated intraocular pressure, globe enlargement and elongated ciliary processes were consistently observed in all affected cats by 8 weeks of age. Varying degrees of optic nerve damage resulted by 6 months of age. Although subtle lens zonular instability was a common feature in this cohort, pronounced ectopia lentis was identified in less than 10% of cats examined. Thus, glaucoma in this pedigree is attributed to histologically confirmed arrest in the early post-natal development of the aqueous humor outflow pathways in the anterior segment of the eyes of affected animals. Using a candidate gene approach, significant linage was established on cat chromosome B3 (LOD 18.38, q = 0.00) using tightly linked short tandem repeat (STR) loci to the candidate gene, LTBP2. A 4 base-pair insertion was identified in exon 8 of LTBP2 in affected individuals that generates a frame shift that completely alters the downstream open reading frame and eliminates functional domains. Thus, we describe the first spontaneous and highly penetrant non-rodent model of PCG, identifying a valuable animal model for primary glaucoma that closely resembles the human disease providing valuable insights into mechanisms underlying the disease and a valuable animal model for testing therapies.

We used RNA sequencing coupled with de novo transcriptome assembly, because the Syrian hamster does not have a fully sequenced and annotated reference genome. Libraries for deep sequencing were constructed from poly-A RNA isolated from the spleens or splenic macrophages of uninfected and 28-day L. donovani-infected hamsters (n=4 per group) using standard Illumina protocols. The library quality was confirmed by Agilent Bioanalyzer. Paired-end 50-base sequencing was performed using TruSeq SBS kit v3 (Illumina) on an Illumina HiSeq 1000.The quality of raw sequencing reads was checked using FastQC (v0.10.1). To avoid the contamination of pathogen sequences, we filtered out reads (using the FASTX Toolkit v0.0.13) that aligned to the Leishmania donovani BPK282A1 genome (NCBI BioProject PRJEA61817) using Bowtie 2 (v2.0.0-beta5) under default options. To reduce the effect of low quality reads, we further filtered out artifacts and reads having a phred score <28 in more than 10% of nucleotides using FASTX Toolkit (v0.0.13). Both forward and reverse reads were removed if any of them failed to pass the filters. To obtain a complete transcriptome, we used two steps. First, the cleaned sequencing reads from different spleen samples were pooled together and de novo assembled using Trinity software. Second, the resulting transcriptome was combined with all cleaned reads from hamster spleen and splenic macrophages and the CHO-K1 RefSeq genome to perform a second de novo assembly using BRANCH. We first created a customized reference library using Rattus norvegicus (Rnor_5.0.73) and Mus musculus (GRCm38.73) genomes. We then used BLAST (v 2.2.28+) to align each transcript generated from BRANCH against the customized library to assign it a gene name based upon sequence similarity. An E-value cutoff of <1e-3 was used. Additionally, we compared the Trinity transcripts with the CHO-K1 Ref Seq genome. All the non-Leishmania-like raw sequencing reads were first mapped to our de novo reference genome using Bowtie2 (v2.1.0) with default options, but allowing one read to map to as many as 500 different transcripts. We then measured the expression abundance, count of reads mapped to each transcript, using the software eXpress. To identify differentially expressed transcripts in each experiment, 3 different approaches were applied: exact tests of Robinson and Smyth and generalized linear models with the likelihood ratio test using the BioConductor R package EdgeR, and the Wald test using DESeq2. Only transcripts with at least 1 count per million in at least 3 out of 4 samples in the control or experimental group were included in the analysis. A transcript was considered differentially expressed only when it was identified by all three different approaches. Analysis of differentially expressed transcripts identified a highly inflammatory spleen environment with abundant expression of type I and type II interferon response genes. However, high IFN-? expression was ineffective in directing exclusive M1 macrophage polarization, suppressing M2-associated gene expression, and restraining parasite replication and disease. While many IFN-inducible transcripts were upregulated in the infected spleen, fewer were induced in splenic macrophages in VL suggesting suppression of macrophage responsiveness to activating cytokines. The transcription factor STAT3 was predicted and confirmed to be activated, and found to orchestrate an exuberant counter-regulatory response that favors parasite replication.

While the LP mutation allows for expression of the various patterns, other loci are responsible for modification of the extent of white. Pedigree analysis of families segregating for high levels of patterning (80-100% white hair coat) indicated a single dominant gene (PATN1) as a major effect modifier for LP. Linkage analysis identified a 16 Mbp region on ECA3p associated with PATN1. Whole transcriptome sequencing of skin samples from horses with and without the PATN1 allele was performed to identify genic SNPs for fine mapping. Two Sequenom assays were utilized to genotype 192 individuals from five LP-containing breeds. The initial panel highlighted a 1.6 Mbp region without a clear candidate gene. In the second round of fine-mapping, a SNP in the 3' UTR of RING finger and WD repeat domain 3 (RFWD3) reached a significance level of p=1.063x10-39. Sequencing of RFWD3 did not identify any coding polymorphisms specific to the PATN1 horses. Genotyping of an additional 52 LP animals increased this association to a p-value of 4.68x10-56. An additional 166 horses of breeds not segregating for LP did not contain the PATN1-associated allele. This variant is a strong candidate for PATN1 and may be used for genotyping lp/lp animals."

Skeletal muscle biopsies were collected at rest from the gluteus medius at two time points: T1 (unconditioned), (9 +/- 0.5 months old) and T2 (conditioned) (20 +/- 0.7 months old). The most highly abundant genes in the muscle transcriptome were those involved in muscle contraction, aerobic respiration and mitochondrial function. A previously unreported over-representation of genes relating to RNA processing, the stress response and proteolysis was observed. Following training 92 tags were differentially expressed of which 74 were annotated. Sixteen genes showed increased expression, including the mitochondrial genes, ACADVL, MRPS21 and SLC25A29.

"In eutherian mammals, dosage compensation of X-linked genes is achieved by X chromosome inactivation. X inactivation is random in embryonic and adult tissues, but imprinted X inactivation (paternal X silencing) has been identified in the extraembryonic membranes of the mouse, rat, and cow.  Few other species have been studied for this trait, and the data from studies of the human placenta have been discordant or inconclusive.  Here, we quantify X inactivation using RNA sequencing of placental tissue from reciprocal hybrids of horse and donkey (mule and hinny).  In placental tissue from the equid hybrids and the horse parent the allelic expression pattern was consistent with random X inactivation, and imprinted X inactivation can clearly be excluded. We characterized horse and donkey XIST gene, and demonstrated that XIST allelic expression in female hybrid placental and fetal tissues is negatively correlated with the other X-linked genes chromosome-wide, which is consistent with the XIST-mediated mechanism of X inactivation discovered previously in mice.  As the most structurally and morphologically diverse organ in mammals, the placenta also appears to show diverse mechanisms for dosage compensation that may result in differences in conceptus development across species.

However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to behavioral plasticity are unclear. Here, we show that the genome dynamically responds to social interactions with multiple waves of transcription associated with distinct molecular functions in the brain of male threespined sticklebacks, a species famous for its behavioral repertoire and evolution. Some biological functions (e.g., hormone activity) peaked soon after a brief territorial challenge and then declined, while others (e.g., immune response) peaked hours afterwards. We identify transcription factors that are predicted to coordinate waves of transcription associated with different components of behavioral plasticity. Next, using H3K27Ac as a marker of chromatin accessibility, we show that a brief territorial intrusion was sufficient to cause rapid and dramatic changes in the epigenome. Finally, we integrate the time course brain gene expression data with a transcriptional regulatory network, and link gene expression to changes in chromatin accessibility. This study reveals rapid and dramatic epigenomic plasticity in response to a brief, highly consequential social interaction. Overall design: Adult males were collected from Putah Creek, a freshwater population, in spring 2013 and maintained in the lab on a 16:8 (L:D) photoperiod and at 18°C in separate 9-liter tanks. Males were provided with nesting material including algae, sand and gravel and were visually isolated from neighbors. All males were in the *territorial* phase of the nesting cycle, i.e. defending a territory. Males were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. Males in the experimental group were presented with a smaller, unrelated male intruder confined to a flask. Males in the control groups were presented with an empty flask. At the same time as a confined intruder was introduced to an experimental male's tank, an empty flask was introduced into a paired control male's tank. After 5 min the flask was removed, and after a predetermined period (see below) males were quickly netted and sacrificed by decapitation within seconds following an IACUC approved protocol (#15077) of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Here we used RNAseq to test whether the embryonic transcriptional response to increased levels of cortisol was similar to the transcriptional response to maternal stress in sticklebacks Methods: Eggs were treated by immersing eggs for 30 mins in water that contained 0, 5, or 10 ug/L, which represented baseline, predator induced, and super physiological levels of maternally derived cortisol. To isolated enough RNA for RNAseq, 10 embyros from each clutch/treatment were pooled prior to RNA extraction for a total of 18 pools (6 clutches x 3 treatments). Results: Analysis of genome-wide transcriptional profiles suggests that 17251 (genes which survived a cut-off of having cpm more than 1 in at least two samples; and had a significant likelihood ratio calculated in edgeR) genes out of the possible 22,456 genes in the stickleback genome were expressed in 72-hour embryos.

Overall design: mRNA profiles of egg clutches treated with 0, 5, or 10 ug/L are compared, which represented baseline, predator induced, and super physiological levels of maternally derived cortisol."

Most of these encode the equine homologs of known protein-coding genes described in other species, yet the potential exists to identify novel and perhaps equine-specific gene structures.  A set of 36 transcripts were prioritized for further study by filtering for levels of expression (depth of RNA-seq read coverage), distance from annotated features in the equine genome, the number of putative exons, and patterns of gene expression between tissues.  From these, four were selected for further investigation based on predicted open reading frames of greater than or equal to 50 amino acids and lack of detectable homology to known genes across species.  Sanger sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons from additional equine samples confirmed expression and structural annotation of each transcript.  Functional predictions were made by conserved domain searches.  A single transcript, expressed in the cerebellum, contains a putative kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, suggesting a potential function associated with zinc finger proteins and transcriptional regulation.  Overall levels of conserved synteny and sequence conservation across a 1MB region surrounding each transcript were approximately 73% compared to the human, canine, and bovine genomes; however, the four loci display some areas of low conservation and sequence inversion in regions that immediately flank these previously unannotated equine transcripts.

The phenotype of equine CVID is similar to that of CVID-affected humans who lack B lymphocytes. We have determined that the loss of B lymphocytes is due to a failure of differentiation in the bone marrow of equine CVID patients. Transcriptome sequencing was undertaken to assess the expression of genes and transcription factors known to be essential for B cell differentiation, and simultaneously obtain a comprehensive view of gene expression in the bone marrow. Analysis of bone marrow mRNA expression from CVID horses revealed a significant decrease in E2A (p < 0.05) and a marked decrease in PAX5 (p < 0.01) expression in comparison to healthy horses. E2A and PAX5 are transcription factors essential to successful B cell differentiation, and are indicative of specific B cell stages.

"SRP051087"	"Equus caballus Transcriptome or Gene expression"	"The physiological changes associated with the varying hormonal environment throughout the oestrous cycle have been analysed in several species. These changes are linked to the many functions the uterus needs to fulfil, such as clearing contaminants introduced via breeding and supporting the development of a foetus. The aim of this study was to generate global gene expression profiles for the equine uterus during oestrus and dioestrus. To achieve this, samples were collected from 5 horses, once during oestrus (follicle > 35mm diameter) and once during dioestrus (5 days post ovulation), and analysed using high throughput RNA-Seq technologies. Genes identified as being differentially expressed between the two cycle stages were further investigated using Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. The expression levels of a total of 1577 genes were found to be significantly up-regulated during oestrus while 1864 genes were expressed at significantly higher levels in dioestrus. Most genes up-regulated during oestrus were associated with the extra-cellular matrix, signal interaction and transduction, cell communication or the immune function, whereas genes expressed at higher levels in dioestrus were most commonly associated with metabolic or transport functions. This correlates well with the physiological functions of the uterus - during oestrus it is expected to be preparing for potential infections facilitated by an open cervix and breeding, while the dioestrous uterus needs to be accommodating to a potential conceptus. These results allow for a more complete understanding of the hormonal influence on gene expression in the equine uterus and provide a valuable baseline for further research in equine reproduction, including analyses of changes associated with infection and inflammation."

The aim of this study was to examine this by means of RNA sequencing. Four days after ovulation, the oviduct epithelial cells ipsilateral and contralateral to the ovulation side from five cyclic and five pregnant mares were collected. mRNA was extracted and samples were sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq-2000 sequencer. Data analysis was performed with the CLC Genomics software and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined (p-value = 0.05 and absolute fold change = 2). ClueGO was used for functional interpretation. A total of 26,991 genes was identified and 253 genes were found to be upregulated and 108 to be downregulated in the pregnant ipsilateral oviduct, when compared to the cyclic ipsilateral oviduct. Comparison of the ipsilateral and the contralateral oviduct indicated 164 DEGs in pregnant mares and 77 DEGs in cyclic mares. Functional enrichment analysis only detected differences in the comparison of pregnant and cyclic ipsilateral oviducts and showed that the equine embryo affects the expression of immune response related genes in the oviduct, with marked upregulation of interferon associated genes. This research represents the foundation for further assessment of the role of specific genes in the early embryo-maternal dialogue of the horse. Overall design: mRNA profiles of epithelial cells of equine oviducts ipsilateral and contralateral to the ovulation side of pregnant and cyclic mares four days after ovulation were examined, resulting in four different conditions (pregnant ipsilateral, pregnant contralateral, cyclic ipsilateral and cyclic contralateral, consisting of five biological replicates each."

Methods: Whole transcriptome profiling of blood was performed for  untrained horses and  horses from which samples were collected during at 3 different periods of training procedure (T1-during intense training period - March, T2- before starts - May and T3 -after flat racing season - October). The muscle transcriptome sequencing was performed for 37 blood samples using Illumina HiScan SQ in 75 single-end cycles. The quantifying transcript abundances was made using the RSEM supported by STAR aligner. The raw reads were aligned to the Equus caballus reference genome. Differentially expressed genes in blood tissue were detected by DESeq2. The RNA-seq results were validated using by qPCR. Results: The increase of the number of DEGs between subsequent training periods has been observed and the highest amount of DEGs was detected between untrained horses (T0) and horses at the end of the racing season (T3) - 440. The comparison of transcriptome of T2 vs T3 and T0 vs T3 showed a significant advantage of up-regulated genes during long-term exercise (up-regulation of 266 and 389 DEGs in T3 period compared T2 and T0; respectively). Our results showed that the largest number of identified genes encoded transcription factors, nucleic acid binding proteins and G-protein modulators, which mainly were transcriptional  activated at the last training phase (T3) . Moreover, in the T3 period the identified DEGs represented genes coded for cytoskeletal proteins including actin cytoskeletal proteins and kinases. The most abundant exercise-upregulated genes were involved in pathways important in regulating the cell cycle (PI3K-Akt signaling pathway), cell communication (cAMP-dependent pathway), proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis as well as immunity processes (Jak-STAT signaling pathway). We also observed exercise induced expression of genes related in regulation of actin cytoskeleton, gluconeogenesis (FoxO signaling pathway; Insulin signaling pathway), glycerophospholipid metabolism and calcium signaling. Conclusions: TOur results allow to identify changes in genes expression profile following training schedule in Arabian horses. Based on comparison analysis of blood transcriptomes, several exercise-regulated pathways and genes most affected by exercise were detected. We pinpointed overrepresented molecular pathways and genes essential for exercise adaptive response via maintaining of body homeostasis. The observed transcriptional activation of such gene as LPGAT1, AGPAT5, PIK3CG, GPD2,  FOXN2, FOXO3, ACVR1B and ACVR2A can be a base for further research in order to identify genes potentially associated with race performance in Arabian horses. Such markers will be essential to choice the training type, and could result in differences in racing performance specific to various breeds.

Methods: Whole transcriptomes between three time points of muscle tissue collection were compared: T0 (untrained horses),  T1 (horses after intense gallop phase) and T2 (at the end of the racing season), in total 23 samples.  The biopsy of gluteus medius muscle was performed by using minimally invasive ProMag Ultra Automatic Biopsy Instrument with a 2 mm diameter biopsy needle. The total RNA was isolated using by TriReagent and 300ng was used to  cDNA libraries preparation.  The NGS sequencing was performed on HiScan SQ (Illumina). The quantifying transcript abundances was made using the RSEM supported by STAR aligner. The raw reads were aligned to the Equus caballus reference genome. Differentially expressed genes were detected by DESeq2. The RNA-seq results were validated using by qPCR. Results: To detected differentially expressed genes during training preparing to the flat racing, whole transcriptomes between three time points of muscle tissue collection were compared: T0 (untrained horses),  T1 (horses after intense gallop phase) and T2 (at the end of the racing season). We identified 1168 DEGs between T0 vs T1; 1593 between T1 vs T2 and 763 between T2 vs T0. The analysis for all DEGs allow to detect 11 pathways which ale significant over represented between at last two training periods. The numerous group of exercise-regulated DEGs was related with muscle cell structure and signaling ('focal adhesion', 'adherens juntion' and 'PI3-ATK signaling') and included insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R); insulin receptor (INSR); transforming growth factor beta receptors 1 and 2 (TGFBR1; TGFBR2); vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB);  epidermal growth factor (EGF); hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor D (FIGF). Our results showed that in Arabian horses exercise modified the expression of genes belonging to the 'PPAR signaling pathway' (e.g. PPARA; PPARD; PLIN2); 'calcium signaling pathway' (e.g. PLN; PLCD1; TNNC1; TNNC2) as well as pathways associated with metabolism processes - 'oxidative phosphorylation'; 'fatty acid metabolism'; 'glycolysis/gluconeogenesis' and 'citrate cycle'. Conclusions: Our research allowed to identify the group of exercise-regulated genes which was related with muscle cell structure as well as signaling and pinpointed the significant metabolic processes critical for adaptive response during training. We confirmed that in Arabians, the exercise switch energy generation towards fatty acid utilization, enhance glycogen transport and calcium signaling. The sequencing of skeletal muscle transcriptome allowed to propose the panel of new candidate genes (such as SLC16A1; ME3; ACTN3; PPARa; SH3RF2; TPM3; TNNC1; TNNI3; TGFBR1; TGFBR2; FABP3) potentially related with body homeostasis maintenance and race performance in Arabian horse.

"SRP007347"	"Profiling of differential allelic expression in horse, donkey, mule and hinny placental tissue"	"The discovery of genomic imprinting through studies of manipulated mouse embryos indicated that the paternal genome has a major influence on placental development.  However, previous research has not demonstrated paternal bias in imprinted genes.  We applied RNA sequencing to trophoblast tissue from reciprocal hybrids of horse and donkey, where genotypic differences allowed parent-of-origin identification of most expressed genes.  Using this approach, we identified a core group of 15 ancient imprinted genes of which 10 were paternally expressed.  An additional 78 candidate novel imprinted genes identified by RNA-seq also showed paternal bias.  Pyrosequencing was used to confirm the imprinting status of six of the novel genes, including the insulin receptor (INSR), which may play a role in growth regulation with its reciprocally imprinted ligand, histone acetyltransferase (HAT1), the first example of an imprinted gene involved in chromatin modification, and LY6G6C, the first imprinted gene to be identified in the major histocompatibility complex.  The 78 novel candidate imprinted genes displayed parent-of-origin expression bias in placenta but not fetus, and most showed less than 100% silencing of the imprinted allele.  Some displayed variability in imprinting status among individuals.  This results in a unique epigenetic signature for each placenta that contributes to variation in the intrauterine environment and thus presents the opportunity for natural selection to operate on parent-of-origin differential regulation.  Taken together, these features highlight the plasticity of imprinting in mammals and the central importance of the placenta as a target tissue for genomic imprinting.

We observed a ~200-base pair (bp) periodic pattern of genetic variation downstream of transcription start sites; the rate of insertions and deletions longer than 1 bp peaked at positions of approximately  200,  400, and  600 bp, whereas the point mutation rate showed corresponding valleys. This ~200-bp periodicity was correlated with the chromatin structure, with nucleosome occupancy minimized at positions 0,  200,  400, and  600 bp.

Results: We have characterized sequence variation and expression properties of this set of TSSs (which we call *Nucleocyclic TSSs*) using germline and somatic cells of three medaka (Oryzias latipes) inbred isolates from different locations. We found nucleocyclic TSSs in medaka to be associated with higher gene expression and characterized by a clear boundary in sequence composition with potentially-nucleosome-destabilizing A/T-enrichment upstream (p<1E-60 ) and nucleosome-accommodating C/G-enrichment downstream (p<1E-40 ) that was highly conserved from an ancestor. A substantial genetic distance between the strains facilitated the in-depth analysis of patterns of fixed mutations, revealing a localization-specific equilibrium between the rates of distinct mutation categories that would serve to maintain the conserved sequence anisotropy around TSSs. Downstream of nucleocyclic TSSs, C to T, T to C, and other mutation rates on the sense strand increased around first nucleosome dyads and decreased around first linkers, which contrasted with genomewide mutational patterns around nucleosomes (p<5%). C to T rates are higher than G to A rates around nucleosome associated with germline nucleocyclic TSS sites (p<5%), potentially due to the asymmetric effect of transcription-coupled repair.

"SRP011081"	"Platypus fibroblast and ovary transcriptomes"	"As a result of sex chromosome differentiation from ancestral autosomes, male mammalian cells only contain one X chromosome. It has long been hypothesized that X-linked gene expression levels have become doubled in males to restore dosage balance between the X and autosomes, and that the resulting X overexpression in females then drove the evolution of X inactivation (XCI). However, this model has never been directly tested and patterns and mechanisms of dosage compensation across different mammals and birds generally remain little understood. We have traced the evolution of dosage compensation using extensive transcriptome data from males and females representing all major mammalian lineages and birds. Our analyses suggest that the X has become globally upregulated in marsupials but probably not in placental mammals, where instead at least a subset of autosomal genes interacting with X-linked were downregulated. Thus, different driving forces may underlie the evolution of XCI and the highly efficient equilibration of X expression levels between the sexes observed for both of these lineages. In the egg-laying monotremes and birds, which have homologous sex chromosome systems, partial upregulation of the X (Z in birds) evolved but is largely restricted to the heterogametic sex, which provides an explanation for the partially sex-biased X (Z) expression and lack of global inactivation mechanisms in these lineages. Our findings suggest that dosage reductions imposed by sex chromosome differentiation events in amniotes were resolved in strikingly different ways. Overall design: 3 samples (ovary, fibroblast male, fibroblast female) from different platypus individuals are analysed."	"SRA"	"total"									"GSE36120"

The evolution of mammalian pregnancy is an excellent system in which to study the origin of novelties because extant mammals preserve major stages in the transition from egg-laying to live-birth. To determine the molecular bases of this transition, we characterized the pregnant/gravid uterine transcriptome from tetrapods, including species in the three major mammalian lineages, and used ancestral transcriptome reconstruction to trace the evolutionary history of uterine gene expression. We show that thousands of genes evolved or lost uterine expression during the origins of mammalian pregnancy, including the loss of genes responsible for the mineralization of the eggshell in the Mammalian and Therian stem-lineages, and the recruitment of genes into uterine expression that mediate maternal-fetal communication and maternal immunotolerance of the fetal allograft in the Therian and Eutherian stem-lineages. Our results indicate that one of the defining mammalian novelties evolved through a step-wise process that dramatically changed uterine gene expression, generating a suite of evolutionary innovations that support prolonged gestations.

"DRP000894"	"Abundant Bidirectional Transcription around Transcription Start Sites in Mammals"	"In mammals, more than 60% of the genome is use for transcription for mRNAs and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). A fraction of ncRNAs have been believed to downregulate the corresponding mRNA expression level in a pre- or post- transcriptional manner by forming RNA-RNA duplex structures.To examine the directional properties of transcription at the whole genome level, we performed directional RNA-seq analysis of mouse brain and heart samples. Our analysis revealed that there is only a small fraction of the genome where both the top and bottom strands are utilized for transcription.A significant fraction of transcription start sites (TSSs) of protein-coding genes contain borders that separate antisense- and sense-biased transcription, suggesting that head-to-head transcription at the TSS is more prevalent than previously thought.The expression of the resultant promoter-associated ncRNAs (pancRNAs) tends to occur together with that of the corresponding mRNA in a coordinated manner. A fraction of genes with tissue-specific pancRNAs show a positive correlation between their pancRNA and mRNA expression, which is in accord with the proposed role for pancRNA in facultative gene activation, whereas genes with constitutive expression lack an association with pancRNA. More than 90% of head-to-head type promoters contain CpG islands. Moreover, CCG and CGG repeats are significantly enriched in the upstream regions and downstream regions, respectively, of TSSs located in head-to-head type promoters.

Most of these studies, however, estimated gene expression levels using microarray probes designed to hybridize to only a small proportion of each gene. Here we used recently-developed RNA sequencing protocols, which side-step this limitation, to assess intra- and inter-species variation in gene regulatory processes in considerably more detail than was previously possible. Specifically, we used RNAseq to study transcript levels in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques, using liver RNA samples from three males and three females from each species. Our approach allowed us to identify a large number of genes whose expression levels likely evolve under natural selection in primates. These include a subset of genes with conserved sexually dimorphic expression patterns across the three species, which we found to be enriched for genes involved in lipid metabolism. Our data also suggest that while alternative splicing is tightly regulated within and between species, sex-specific and lineage-specific changes in the expression of different splice forms are also frequent. Intriguingly, among genes in which a change in exon usage occurred exclusively in the human lineage, we found an enrichment of genes involved in anatomical structure and morphogenesis, raising the possibility that differences in the regulation of alternative splicing have been an important force in human evolution.

A major pattern of the overlapped genes reflects the aberrant acceleration of synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation followed by premature synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex of autism patients. This pattern involves the same developmental program that controls human-specific extension of cortical synaptogenesis in healthy individuals.

As such, identifying the origins of variation is a fundamental goal of biology. We investigated the link between gene interactions and variation in gene expression among individuals and species, using the mammalian limb as a model system. We first built interaction networks for key genes regulating early (outgrowth; E9.5-11) and late (expansion and elongation; E11-13) limb development in mouse. This resulted in an Early (ESN) and Late (LSN) Stage Network. Computational perturbations of these networks suggest that the ESN is more robust. We then quantified levels of the same key genes among mouse individuals, and found that they vary less at earlier limb stages and that variation in gene expression is heritable. Finally, we quantified variation in gene expression levels among four mammals with divergent limbs (bat, opossum, mouse and pig), and found that levels vary less among species at earlier limb stages. We also found that variation in gene expression levels among individuals and species are correlated for earlier and later limb development. In conclusion, results are consistent with the robustness of the ESN buffering among-individual variation in gene expression levels early in mammalian limb development, and constraining the evolution of early limb development among mammalian species.

The initial exposure caused two behavioral effects at the individual level: an increase in the intensity of aggression toward a second intruder at 30 and 60 minutes, and an increased probability of responding aggressively toward a second intruder that persisted for two hours. The shorter-lived response was associated with one pattern of gene expression in the mushroom bodies, highlighted by genes related to cytoskeleton remodeling. The longer-lived response was associated with a different pattern; highlighted by genes related to hormones, stress response and transcription factors. Histone profiling revealed few changes in chromatin accessibility in response to social challenge; most differentially expressed genes were *ready* to be activated.

This species includes multiple cave-dwelling populations that have colonized the dark, subterranean environment, and repeatedly evolved a suite of troglomorphic traits, including eye degeneration, loss of pigmentation, alterations in behavior, increased number of taste buds, and an enhanced lateral line system. To investigate the genetic changes associated with cave colonization, we have utilized RNA-seq technologies to compare gene expression variation between surface- and cave-dwelling forms of Astyanax mexicanus. This approach includes a dynamic comparison across four critical stages of early development wherein many troglomorphic-specific traits appear.

Despite their wide distribution, pike populations have low levels of polymorphism and divergence, indicative of a recent common ancestor. Pike often function as sentinel species to monitor pollutants in northern waters. Mitochondrial studies have shown that Escosiformes is the closest living order to Salmoniformes. Esociformes, an old lineage with fossils dating back to 70MYA, contains 10 species (pike, muskellunge and mudminnows) of which most literature concerns pike. The genome size for pike is 1.1pg and its karyotype is 2N=50 NF=50, similar to ancestral karyotypes of many teleosts (2N=48-50, FN=48-50). This compares to the much larger Atlantic salmon karyotype of 2N=56-60, NF=74 and genome size =3.1pg.

"SRP050607"	"RNA-seq analysis reveals significant transcriptome changes in turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) suffering severe enteromyxosis"	"Background: Enteromyxosis caused by the intestinal myxozoan parasite Enteromyxum scophthalmi is a serious threat for turbot (Scophthalmus maximus, L.) aquaculture, causing severe catarrhal enteritis leading to a cachectic syndrome, with no therapeutic options available. There are still many aspects of host-parasite interaction and disease pathogenesis that are yet to be elucidated, and to date, no analysis of the transcriptomic changes induced by E. scophthalmi in turbot organs has been conducted. In this study, RNA-seq technology was applied to head kidney, spleen and pyloric caeca of severely infected turbot with the aim of furthering our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms and turbot immune response against enteromyxosis. Results: A huge amount of information was generated with more than 23,000 identified genes in the three organs, amongst which 4,762 were differently expressed (DE) between infected and control fish. Associate gene functions were studied based on gene ontology terms and available literature, and the most interesting DE genes were classified into five categories: 1) immune and defence response; 2) apoptosis and cell proliferation; 3) iron metabolism and erythropoiesis; 4) cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix and 5) metabolism and digestive function. The analysis of down-regulated genes of the first category revealed evidences of a connexion failure between innate and adaptive immune response, especially represented by a high number of DE interferon-related genes in the three organs. Furthermore, we found an intense activation of local immune response at intestinal level that appeared exacerbated, whereas in kidney and spleen genes involved in adaptive immune response were mainly down-regulated. The apoptotic machinery was only clearly activated in pyloric caeca, while kidney and spleen showed a marked depression of genes related to erythropoiesis, probably related to disorders in iron homeostasis. The genetic signature of the causes and consequences of cachexia was also demonstrated by the down-regulation of the genes encoding structural proteins and those involved in the digestive metabolism. Conclusions: This transcriptomic study has enabled us to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of enteromyxosis and identify a large number of DE target genes that bring us closer to the development of strategies designed to effectively combat this pathogen. Overall design: Four samples per organ (kidney, spleen and pyloric caeca) were sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000 as 100bp paired-end reads. For each organ, three samples were taken from Enteromyxum severely infected turbot and the remaining one was a pool of three control turbot."	"SRA"	"partial"	"NA"								"GSE63911, PRJNA269386"

"SRP068062"	"Transcriptome responses to selection for tame/aggressive behaviors in silver foxes (Vulpes vulpes)"	"Domestication leads to a spectrum of striking behavioral changes whose genetic basis remains largely unknown. Silver foxes have been selectively bred for tame and aggressive behaviors for over 50 years at the Institute for Cytology and Genetics in Novosibirsk, Russia. To further understand the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms underlying tame and aggressive behavioral phenotypes segregating in selected strains of the silver fox, we quantified genome-wide gene expression levels using RNA-seq in two selected brain tissues, right prefrontal cortex and basal forebrain, from 12 aggressive and 12 tame individuals. Expression analysis reveals 146 differentially expressed genes in prefrontal cortex between tame and aggressive individuals at a 5% FDR, and 33 hits were found in basal forebrain. These candidates include genes in key pathways known to be critical to neurological processing, such as serotonin and glutamate receptor pathways. The data relate in interesting ways to neurological and pharmacological effects that are actively being studied to understand human aggression. In addition, we identified 31,000 high quality exonic SNPs, 295 of which show significant allele frequency differences between tame and aggressive individuals at an adjust P-value < 0.05 level from gene dropping simulation based on the entire pedigrees. A non-synonymous change in a glutamate receptor, GRM3, is among these significant SNPs, indicating that expression and allele-frequency changes are hitting the same pathways. These changes in expression level and allele frequency might be the direct response to the artificial selection and will help understand the genetic basis of mammalian domestication process.

"SRP012475"	"RNA-seq analysis of differential gene expression in liver from lactating dairy cows divergent in negative energy balance"	"Background: The liver is central to most economically important metabolic processes in cattle. However, the changes in expression of genes that drive these processes remain incompletely characterised. RNA-seq is the new gold standard for whole transcriptome analysis but so far there are no reports of its application to analysis of differential gene expression in cattle liver. We used RNA-seq to study differences in expression profiles of hepatic genes and their associated pathways in individual cattle in either mild negative energy balance (MNEB) or severe negative energy balance (SNEB). NEB is an imbalance between energy intake and energy requirements for lactation and body maintenance. This aberrant metabolic state affects high-yielding dairy cows after calving and is of considerable economic importance because of its negative impact on fertility and health in dairy herds. Analysis of changes in hepatic gene expression in SNEB animals will increase our understanding of NEB and contribute to the development of strategies to circumvent it.     Results: RNA-seq analysis was carried out on total RNA from liver from early post partum Holstein Friesian cows in MNEB (n=5) and SNEB (n=6). 12,833 genes were deemed to be expressed (>4 reads per gene per animal), 413 of which were shown to be statistically significantly differentially expressed (SDE) at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1% and 200 of which were SDE (FDR of 0.1%) with a =2-fold change between MNEB and SNEB animals. GOseq/KEGG pathway analysis showed that SDE genes with =2- fold change were associated (P <0.05) with 9 KEGG pathways. Seven of these pathways were related to fatty acid metabolism and unexpectedly included *Steroid hormone biosynthesis*, a process which mainly occurs in the reproductive organs rather than the liver.    Conclusions: RNA-seq analysis showed that the major changes at the level of transcription in the liver of SNEB cows were related to fat metabolism. *Steroid hormone biosynthesis*, a process that normally occurs in reproductive tissue, was significantly associated with changes in gene expression in the liver of SNEB cows. Changes in gene expression were found in this pathway that have not been previously been identified in SNEB cows.

"SRP014561"	"Comparative transcriptome analysis of various adipose depots in Hanwoo"	"*Background: Adipocytes mainly function as energy storage and endocrine cells.  The amount and distribution of fat are important factor that influence the meat quality in the beef industry.  Fat depot can be found around internal organ (ometal), beneath the skin (subcutaneous), and between muscles (intramuscular).  Different adipose depot showed the biological and genetic difference depending on their location.  This inter-depot variation might be influenced by the inherent genetic programing for development of adipose depots.  In this study, we used RNA-seq data to investigate the difference in transcriptome of various adipose depots in Hanwoo. *Results: Using RNA-seq, we identified 5797, 2156, and 5455 DEGs in the comparison between OI, OS, and IS respectively (FDR<0.01) and found 853, 48, and 979 DEGs specific to subcutaneous, intramuscular and omental fat respectively.  DEGs in intramuscular fat were highly enriched the metabolism related pathways compared to other fat depots. DEGs specific to the omental fat is significantly enriched in PPAR signaling pathway and cell-junction related pathway.  In subcutaneous fat, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction with chemokines (CXC and CC subfamily) was the most significantly enriched the pathways.  Interestingly, melanogenesis pathway was associated with the subcutaneous depot.  Even though the adipose tissues shared the same pathways for adipocyte differentiation, the regulation of genes were different based on the depot. *Conclusions: We comparatively analyzed the transcripome profile from different adipose tissues using NGS and identified DEGs between adipose depot and specific to depot in Hanwoo animals.  The functional annotation analysis of DEGs found that transcriptome profile difference in various adipose tissue of intramuscular, subcutaneous, and ometal fat.

"SRP026485"	"RNA-seq analysis of differential gene expression in muscle from angus beef steers undergoing diet restriction and compensatory growth"	"The objective of this study was to examine changes in muscle gene expression of growing steers during a period of dietary energy restriction followed by a period of realimentation. Crossbred Aberdeen Angus x Holstein Friesian (n = 24) steers were assigned to one of two feeding treatments. Over a 99 d period, 1 group (n=12) was offered a high energy control diet consisting of concentrates ad libitum and 7 kg of grass silage per head daily. The second group (n=12) was offered an energy restricted diet consisting of grass silage ad libitum plus 0.5 kg of concentrate per head per day. From the end of the differential feeding period (99 d), both groups of animals were offered a total mixed ration (grass silage:concentrate ratio of 80:20). This period, which lasted 200 d, was known as the realimentation period. All animals were slaughtered on d 299 of the study. Muscle biopsies were collected at 2 time points (end of the differential feeding period (d 99) and during the realimentation period (d131). RNA was extracted and muscle gene expression was examined using RNA-seq technology and bioinformatic analysis. During the differential feeding period, 17 over-represented pathways were identified, including the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor signalling, glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis and metabolic pathways controlling the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins which indicate reduced energy intake and fat tissue accumulation occurring in muscle tissue during the restriction phase. During the realimentation period, 164 differentially expressed genes were annotated to 9 over-represented pathways including starch and sucrose metabolism, carbohydrate digestion and absorption and TGF-beta signalling pathway. It is hypothesised that the signalling effects of the TGF-beta pathway were reduced thereby promoting accelerated cell growth and proliferation in muscle tissue of animals experiencing compensatory growth. This information can be exploited in genomic breeding programmes to assist selection of cattle with a greater ability to compensate following a period dietary restriction. Overall design: 24 muscle RNA samples were analysed in total. 6 samples were from muscle biopsies collected at the end of a period of dietary restriction (d99) and 6 samples were from muscle biopsies collected at the peak of compensatory growth (d131). In addition, RNA was also analysed from 6 samples collected from animals fed ad libitum at each of these two timepoints."	"SRA"	"total"	"NA"								"GSE48481"

Herein, we characterized the transcriptome of five reproductive tissues (i.e. hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovary, uterus, and endometrium) as well as tissues known to be relevant to growth and metabolism needed for cattle to achieve puberty (i.e., longissimus dorsi muscle, fat, and liver). These tissues were collected from pre (PRE)- and post (POST)-pubertal Brangus (3/8 Brahman; Bos indicus x 5/8 Angus; Bos taurus) heifers derived from a population of cattle used to identify QTL associated with fertility traits. In order to exploit the power of complementary omics analyses, PRE and POST puberty co-expression gene networks were constructed by combining the results from RNA-Seq, GWAS, and bovine transcription factors. RNA-Seq of 8 tissues among PRE and POST Brangus heifers revealed 1515 differentiallyexpressed and 943 tissue-specific genes within the 17,832 genes confirmed by metrics of RNA-Seq analysis. Combining the results from RNA-Seq and GWAS indentified a total of 25 QTL associated to heifer fertility. The hypothalamus experienced the most notable up-regulation of genes via puberty. Complementary omics procedures revealed 2,450 co-expressed genes across the 8 tissues relative to puberty. The PRE network had 372,861 connections whereas the POST network had 328,357 connections. A sub-network from this process revealed key transcriptional regulators (i.e., PITX2, FOXA1, TSG1D1, DACH2, LHX4, PROP1 and SIX6).  Results from multiples sources of omics data will facilitate the design of breeding strategies to improve fertility in Bos indicus-influenced composite cattle.

"SRP033585"	"Transcriptome analysis of the bovine Y chromosome"	"The male-specific region of the mammalian Y chromosome (MSY) contains clusters of genes essential for male reproduction. The highly repetitive and degenerative nature of the Y chromosome impedes genomic and transcriptomic characterization. Although the Y chromosome sequence is available for the human, chimpanzee, and macaque, little is known about the annotation and transcriptome of nonprimate MSY. Here, we investigated the transcriptome of the MSY in cattle by direct testis cDNA selection and RNA-seq approaches. The bovine MSY differs radically from the primate Y chromosomes with respect to its structure, gene content, and density. Among the 28 protein-coding genes/families identified on the bovine MSY (12 single- and 16 multicopy genes), 16 are bovid specific. The 1,274 genes identified in this study made the bovine MSY gene density the highest in the genome; in comparison, primate MSYs have only 31-78 genes. Our results, along with the highly transcriptional activities observed from these Y-chromosome genes and 375 additional noncoding RNAs, challenge the widely accepted hypothesis that the MSY is gene poor and transcriptionally inert. The bovine MSY genes are predominantly expressed and are differentially regulated during the testicular development. Synonymous substitution rate analyses of the multicopy MSY genes indicated that two major periods of expansion occurred during the Miocene and Pliocene, contributing to the adaptive radiation of bovids. The massive amplification and vigorous transcription suggest that the MSY serves as a genomic niche regulating male reproduction during bovid expansion."	"SRA"	"total"	"NA"								"NA"

We identified hundreds of ligand-receptors pairs that can transduce paracrine signaling between oocyte and cumulus. Several of the ligand-coding genes expressed in oocytes and cumulus cells are also functionally associated with regulation of transcription. Ligand-coding genes expressed in oocytes or cumulus showed distinct enrichment for biological functions that are likely associated with a coordinated formation of the transzonal projections from the cumulus that reach the oocyte's membrane. Finally, there were thousands of gene pairs with non-trivial linear co-expression pattern between oocytes and cumulus cells.

Samples were collected from Chinese Qinchuan fetal bovine, heifers, bulls, and steers. We unambiguously detected a substantial number of differently expressed genes (DEGs), novel transcript units (NTUs), and splicing variants.The expressional profile of adipose tissue changed considerably from fetuses to adults, whereas smaller differences were detected between the adipose tissues of adult cows (ATACs). As an endocrine organ, DEGs related to inflammatory and immune process were significantly enriched in the ATACs. These genes may play some roles in different regulation mechanisms of adipose tissue in different genders. In addition, adipose tissue abundantly expressed genes concerning the functions of the mitochondria and the ribosomes. These support the adipose tissue as an extremely active tissue for energy and protein metabolism besides the storage of surplus fuel. In this study, about two-thirds of the NTUs did not have coding ability. Both the NTUs with and without coding ability were enriched from 300bp to 1,500bp. The main difference in the number of the two types of NTUs was also concentrated in this range.  In total, about 18.2% of the genes in adipose tissues were alternatively spliced, and half of them were specially expressed in different patterns. Combined with previous studies, we concluded that alternatively splicing events occur variously in different tissues or different patterns of adipose tissue. Taken together, our study provided complete datasets involving the spatial and temporal transcriptome of adipose tissue which suggested the complexity of adipose tissue and our study will provide essential information for further research.

Calving interval is a trait used to measure reproductive efficiency. Here we used a novel lactating Holstein cow model with genetic and phenotypic divergence in calving interval. Cows had similar genetic merit for milk production traits, but either very good genetic merit for fertility (Fert+; n = 7) or very poor genetic merit for fertility (Fert-; n = 6). We sequenced the transcriptome of endometrial biopsies collected on day 7 of the estrous cycle, a crucial stage for establishment of pregnancy. Significant differential expression (FDR adjusted p < 0.1) of 403 genes was found between the  Fert+ and Fert- animals. A standard over-representation analysis resulted in 12 lowly populated canonical pathways; however a novel in-depth analysis revealed a core of eighteen genes both differentially expressed and highly abundant. Almost all of these genes were related to actin-related and cytoskeletal components of the endometrium; fundamental cell-structure differences existed between  Fert+ and Fert- phenotypes. We also present results indicating inflammation-related genes are down-regulated, and that multiple ion transporters and gated-voltage channels were up-regulated, in Fert+ cows. These three topics are discussed in terms of the uterus and in the context of fertility during early embryo development. Transcriptomic data analysis is complex; we use a method that filters those genes that may be of greatest importance to the tissue at the timepoint of sampling.

In addition, no previous attempts have been made to detect quantitative traits such as milk production related traits, associated genes on RNA-seq experiment with several biological replicates. Research in this field is necessary as bovine milk is a primary source of nutrition for humans. Results : We investigated advantages of using linear models with continuous response variables over converted group variables in a Holsteins' milk. Suggested methods were more suitable in detection of significant genes in our analysis; the proportion of false discoveries to total significant genes was observed to be much lower compared to the precedent approaches we employed. These were observed through mock comparison studies and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Conclusion : Several milk production related genes and pathways were identified from the suggested methods. Given the current trend in RNA-seq pricing, we expect our methods to be successfully applied in various RNA-seq studies with numerous biological replicates that handle continuous response traits.

Complex systemic and local processes involving gluconeogenesis, energy balance, utilisation of body reserves, insulin resistance and involution of the uterus can have an effect on animal health and farm profitability. Here we used an established Holstein cow model of fertility that displayed genetic and phenotypic divergence in calving interval, a trait used to define reproductive performance using a national breeding index in Ireland. Cows had similar genetic merit for milk production traits, but either very good genetic merit for fertility ('Fert+'; n = 8) or very poor genetic merit for fertility ('Fert-'; n = 8). We investigated three distinct time-points, late pregnancy, early lactation and mid lactation (-18, 1 and 147 days on average with day 0 being birth), using RNA sequencing from both liver and muscle tissue biopsies and conducting a differential expression (DE) analysis. We found 807 and 815 unique genes to be DE in at least one time-point in liver and muscle respectively, of which 79% and 83% were only found in a single time-point; 40 and 41 genes were found DE at every time-point indicating possibly systemic or chronic dysregulation. Functional annotation resulted in evidence for two major physiological processes: immune and inflammation, and metabolic, lipid and carbohydrate-binding. These processes indicate areas of previous interest as well as specific systems that appear differentially regulated, and point towards interesting avenues of further research in a broad and complex field.

"SRP050127"	"Ruminal transcriptomic analysis of grass-fed and grain-fed Angus beef cattle"	"Beef represents a major diet component and one of the major sources of protein in human. The beef industry in the United States is currently undergoing changes and is facing increased demands especially for natural grass-fed beef. The grass-fed beef obtained their nutrients directly from pastures, which contained limited assimilable energy but abundant amount of fiber. On the contrary, the grain-fed steers received a grain-based regime that served as an efficient source of high-digestible energy. Lately, ruminant animals have been accused to be a substantial contributor for the green house effect. Therefore, the concerns from environmentalism, animal welfare and public health have driven consumers to choose grass-fed beef. Rumen is one of the key workshops to digest forage constituting a critical step to supply enough nutrients for animals' growth and production. We hypothesize that rumen may function differently in grass- and grain-fed regimes. The objective of this study was to find the differentially expressed genes in the ruminal wall of grass-fed and grain-fed steers, and then explore the potential biopathways. In this study, the RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) method was used to measure the gene expression level in the ruminal wall. The total number of reads per sample ranged from 24,697,373 to 36,714,704. The analysis detected 342 differentially expressed genes between ruminal wall samples of animals raised under different regimens. The Fisher's exact test performed in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software found 16 significant molecular networks. Additionally, 13 significantly enriched pathways were identified, most of which were related to cell development and biosynthesis. Our analysis demonstrated that most of the pathways enriched with the differentially expressed genes were related to cell development and biosynthesis. Our results provided valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms resulting in the phenotype difference between grass-fed and grain-fed cattle. Overall design: Ruminal wall samples from two randomly chosen animals per group were obtained, totaling four samples. The animals were born, raised and maintained at the Wye Angus farm. This herd, which has been closed for almost 75 years and yielded genetically similar progenies, constitutes an excellent resource to perform transcriptomic analysis. The genetic resemblance among individuals permits us to better control the cause of variation between experimental clusters and individuals. The randomly chosen pairs of animals were part of larger sets of steers that received a particular treatment. All animals received the same diet until weaning. The grain group received conventional diet consisting of corn silage, shelled corn, soy bean and trace minerals. The grass fed steers consumed normally grazed alfalfa; during wintertime, bailage was utilized. The alfalfa has been harvested from land without any fertilizers, pesticides or other chemicals. The steers ate no animal, agricultural or industrial byproducts and never receive any type of grain. Then, the calves were randomly assigned to one diet and exclusively received that regimen until termination. Grain-fed animals reached the market weight around the age of 14 month-old, however, grass-fed steers required approximately 200 additional days to achieve the same weight. Immediately after termination at the Old Line Custom Meat Company (Baltimore, MD) a small piece of ruminal wall was excised, cleaned and preserved at -80°C for posterior processing."

The first 125 days of the trial were denoted as Peirod 1, during which treatment groups were fed differentially. The subsequent 55 days, denoted as Period 2 during which all bulls were fed ad libitum. All bulls received the same diet of 70% concentrate 30% grass silage through out the experimental trial,with the amount of feed provided different dependnet on each treatment group. At the end of each period, 10 animals from each treatment group (10, restricted fed and 10 ad libitum fed) were slaughtered and hepatic tissue collected within thirty minutes of slaughter. RNA was extracted and hepatic gene expression was examined using RNAseq technology and bioinformatic analysis. During the differential feeding period, over-represented pathways including amino acid and lipid metabolism, protein synthesis and cell cycle/proliferation were identified, which indicate alterations in metabolic and growth rate in the liver during dietary restriction . During the realimentation period, pathways involved in cell cycle and cell growth as well as protein synthesis were over-represented, with the direction of fold changes opposite to that of these pathways in Period 1. This information can be exploited in genomic breeding programmes to assist selection of cattle with a greater ability to compensate following a period dietary restriction.

Furthermore, it is important to employ a variety of tissues in RNA-seq experiment because recent studies imply gene expression pattern are highly tissue specific. Although previous related studies discovered numerous sexually dimorphic mechanism in mammal species, but still, many mechanisms are undiscovered in case of non-model organisms. One of the representative mammal organism is a cattle which is less researched about sexual dimorphism. For investigate bovine sexual dimorphism, we generated two-way factorial designed 40 samples RNA-seq data composed with two factors such as gender and tissues. Two statistical approaches are employed for identifying bovine sexually dimorphic genes using such two-way factorial designed RNA-seq data. As a result, we observed that detected sexually dimorphic genes exhibited strong tissue specific pattern, but fat tissue showed relatively small tissue specificity than the others. In addition, we observed that sex-related genes are shared in two mammal species such as cattle and rat through qRT-PCR experiments. Finally, we investigated pros and cons of two statistical approaches for complex structured RNA-seq analysis.

However, limit studies on the overall expression status of lncRNAs during muscle development have been conducted. To explore the potential functions of lncRNAs in cattle muscle development, we employed Ribo-Zero-Seq to systematically identify lncRNAs expressed in embryonic (90 day), neonatal (3-day-old) and adult (24-month-old) longissimus muscle (LM) of Qinchuan steers. We finally defined 7692 high-confidence lncRNAs. Further data analyses showed that a total of 401 lncRNAs were differentially expressed among three tested samples, including H19, linc-MD1 and TCONS_00154844. Interestingly, the chromosomal location of linc-MD1 and TCONS_00154844 is overlapped with miR-206/miR-133b or miR-1-2/miR-133a-2 cluster, respectively. miR-1, miR-133 and miR-206 are the most extensively studied miRNAs involved in myogenesis. The genomic close positional relationship between linc-MD1 and miR-206/miR-133b, TCONS_00154844 and miR-1-2/miR-133a-2 strongly indicated that these lncRNAs may play crucial roles in muscle development. GO annotation and KEGG analyses demonstrated that the lncRNAs-targeted mRNAs were related to myogenic differentiation, including metabolic pathways, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

Besides energy, these two types of diet differ in a large number of nutritional components. Additionally, animals maintained on rich-energy regimen are more likely to develop metabolic disorders and infectious diseases than pasture raised individuals. Thus, we hypothesize that spleen-the main immune organ-may function differently under disparate regimes. The objective of this study was to find the differentially expressed genes in the spleen of grass-fed and grain-fed steers, and furtherly explore the potential involved biopathways. Through RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), we detected 123 differentially expressed genes. Based on these genes, we performed an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and identified 9 significant molecular networks and 13 enriched biological pathways. Two of the pathways, Nur77 signaling in T lymphocytes and calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis which are immune related, contain a pair of genes HLA-DRA and NR4A1 with dramatically altered expression level. Collectively, our results provided valuable insights into understanding the molecular mechanism of spleen under varied feeding regimens.

"SRP059849"	"Integrated metabolomic and transcriptome analyses reveal finishing forage affects metabolic pathways related to beef quality and animal welfare"	"Beef represents a major diet component and source of protein in many countries. With an increment demand for beef, the industry is currently undergoing changes towards natural produced beef. Consumers not only concern about product quality, but also for the well-being of animals. Therefore, the consumption of grass-fed meat is continuously growing. However, the nutritional true differences between feeding systems are still unclear. The aim of this study was to examine latissimus dorsi muscle quality and animal welfare by transcriptome and metabolome profiles, and to identify biological pathways related to the differences between grass- and grain-fed Angus steers. By RNA-Seq analysis of latissimus dorsi muscle, we have recognized 241 differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.1). The metabolome examination of muscle and blood revealed 163 and 179 altered compounds in each tissue (P-value < 0.05), respectively.  Accordingly, alterations in glucose metabolism, divergences in free fatty acids and carnitine conjugated lipid levels, and altered beta-oxidation, have been observed. In summary, this study demonstrates a unique transcriptomic and metabolic signature in the muscle of grain and grass finished cattle. Results support the accumulation of anti-inflammatory n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in grass finished cattle, while higher levels of n6 PUFAs in grain finished animals may promote inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, grass-fed animals produce tender beef with lower total fat and higher omega3/omega6 ratio than grain fed animals, which could potentially benefit consumer health. Finally, blood cortisol levels strongly indicate that grass fed animals experience less stress than the grass fed individuals Overall design: The steers came from a closed Wye Angus herd with very similar genetics. The grass-fed group was comprised of steers that received alfalfa and orchard grass hay, clover and orchard grass pasture, or orchard grass and alfalfa pasture. The grass-fed individuals consumed grazed alfalfa upon availability and bales during winter and were not exposed to any corn, any form of grain or feed by-products.

In Experiment 1, cyclic (non-bred, n = 6) and pregnant (artificially inseminated, n = 11) heifers were slaughtered on Day 3 after estrus, and the ampulla and isthmic regions of the oviduct ipsilateral to the corpus luteum were separately flushed. Oviductal epithelial cells from the isthmus region, in which all oocytes/embryos were located, were snap-frozen for microarray analysis. In Experiment 2, heifers were divided into cyclic (non-bred, n = 6) or pregnant (multiple embryo transfer, n = 10) groups. In vitro-produced presumptive zygotes were transferred endoscopically to the ipsilateral oviduct on Day 1.5 post estrus (n = 50 zygotes per heifer). Heifers were slaughtered on Day 3 and oviductal isthmus epithelial cells were recovered for RNA sequencing. Microarray analysis in Experiment 1 failed to detect any difference in the transcriptome of the oviductal isthmus induced by the presence of a single embryo. In Experiment 2, following multiple embryo transfer, RNA sequencing revealed 278 differentially expressed genes of which 123 were up- and 155 were down-regulated in pregnant heifers.

The calves were gradually weaned over 14 days (day (d) -13 to d 0) and mRNA transcription was examined one day before gradual weaning was initiated (d -14), one day after weaning (d 1) and 8 days after weaning (d 8). RNA-seq analysis was carried out on RNA extracted from whole blood. Gradual weaning had no effect on gene expression (P>0.05).There were 550 differentially expressed genes at a false discovery rate of 10% and with a =1.5-fold change, between Holstein-Friesian and Jersey  calves on d -14, 490 on d 1, and 411 on d 8. GOseq/KEGG pathway analysis showed that the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway and the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway were over-represented between breeds on all days (P<0.01; Q=0.1). These results demonstrate that the gradual weaning practiced here does not compromise the welfare of artificially-reared dairy calves, evidenced by the lack of expression changes in any genes in response to gradual weaning. These data also suggest differences in cell signalling and immune responses between breeds. Overall design: Eight Holstein-Friesian and eight Jersey bull calves were group housed indoors and individually fed milk replacer and concentrate using an automatic feeder. Calves were gradually weaned by reducing milk-replacer from 6 litres to 0 litres over 14 days (d) (d -13 to d 0). Calves were blood sampled on d -14, 1, and 8, relative to weaning (d 0).

However, DNA methylation in the cattle genome is not well understood. Here we presented the first single-base-resolution maps of DNA methylation in 10 diversely somatic tissues harvested from the sequenced Hereford cow L1 Dominette 01449 and her relatives using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS). In total, we observed 1,868,049 high accuracy cytosines that located in the CG enriched regions. Similar to the methylation patterning in other species, the CG context was predominant methylated. Widespread differences were identified between the methylation patterns of CG and non-CG contexts. They were distributed differentially among the genomic features, including the genic regions, CpG islands, and repetitive sequences. Autocorrelation analysis among adjacent residues illustrated that methylation level of CGs were highly correlated in a region. In contrast, weak or no correlation was found among non-CGs or between CGs and non-CGs. The distinct distribution and low correlation of CG and non-CG methylation suggested that non-CG methylation may be independent from CG methylation and may be mediated by different mechanisms. We also detected 798 tissue-specific differentially methylated cytosines (tDMC) and 131 tissue-specific differentially methylated CpG islands. Combined analysis with the RNA-seq data, we discovered several non-CGs in tDMCs also highly correlated with gene expression, which implied the potential function of non-CG methylation in somatic cells in addition to pluripotent cells. In summary, we showed that non-CGs exist in bovine tissues and some of them were correlated with tissue-specific functions. This study provided essential information for the cytosine methylation patterning in bovine somatic tissues.

In this study the differences in biological functions and pathways of three crossbreds including 50 and 75 percent Holstein were compared with their purebred parents, Holstein and Taleshi (an indigenous breed) cattle. Results: Five populations and their ten comparisons were studied by bioinformatics tools for transcriptome analysis. We pooled blood RNA of at least 8 animals of each population prior to RNA sequencing. The obtained results showed that total expressed transcripts in all populations were 72,812 with 22,627 annotated genes. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that the genetics information processing and metabolism were the most highly-impacted pathways. Among all significantly enriched pathways, eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2 signaling had the highest activation z-score (5.3) in crossbred compared to purebred cattle. The majority of upstream regulators of genes including transcription regulators and cytokines were differentially expressed among populations in which their activation z-score in purebred was more than crossbred cattle. Conclusions: Crossing of Holstein with Taleshi breed resulted in higher activity of pathways related to genetic information processing and lower activity of pathways related to immunity and inflammatory responses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where the differences in pathways and functions were studied using high throughput sequencing of blood in a cattle crossbreeding program. The analysis revealed that the most important differences between studied genotypes, especially between purebred and crossbred cattle, were related to immune functions and metabolism.

Therefore, a cattle muscle transcriptome analysis was performed to compare gene expression profiles between embryonic stage and adult stage. Results: Total RNAs from the Qinchuan cattle skeletal muscle at fetal and adult stages were used to construct libraries for Illumina next-generation sequencing using Ribo-Zero RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) method. We found a total of 19,695 genes were expressed in the embryo and adult, and 3,299 and 433 genes were present only in the embryo and adult, respectively. Over 5,000 unigenes were significantly different (P < 0.05) when comparing fetal and adult patterns. We further characterized GosB, which was abundant in skeletal muscle, as the candidate gene to explore its role in cattle development. GosB increased the number of C2C12 myoblasts in S phase, and decreased the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase. GosB promoted proliferation and protect the C2C12 cells from apoptosis via regulating Bcl-2 expression and controlling the intracellular calcium concentration. Conclusions: Modulation of GosB expression in muscle tissue may emerge as potent tool to control myoblast number in the cattle.

All bulls received the same diet of 70% concentrate 30% grass silage through out the experimental trial,with the amount of feed provided different dependent on each treatment group. At the end of Period 1, 9 animals from each treatment group were slaughtered, with 10 animals from each treatment slaughtered at the end of Period 2. Rumen epithelium was collected from all animals within thirty minutes of slaughter. RNA was extracted and rumen epithelium gene expression was examined using RNAseq technology on all samles collected (end of Period 1: 9 samples each from ADLIB and RES groups; end of Period 2: 10 samples each from ADLIB and RES groups). Genes identified as differentially expressed in response to both dietary restriction and subsequent compensatory growth included those involved in processes such as cellular interactions and transport, protein folding and gene expression, as well as immune response. This information can be exploited in genomic breeding programmes to assist selection of cattle with a greater ability to compensate following a period dietary restriction. Overall design: 38 rumen epithelium RNA samples were analyzed in total.

To investigate these processes, RNA-sequencing of two tissues, uterine endothelium adjacent to the umbilical attachment site and fetal thymus, was performed 21 days post challenge on four groups of fetuses selected from a large PRRSV challenge experiment of pregnant gilts. Overall design: RNA-seq experiment compared gene expression between four different groups of fetuses (n=12 per group): control (CON-uninfected fetuses from mock inoculated gilts), UNINF (uninfected fetuses from PRRSV-inoculated gilts), INF (infected fetuses from PRRSV-inoculated gilts), and meconium-stained fetuses (MEC-meconium-stained fetuses from PRRSV-inoculated gilts) and investigated two tissues: uterine endometrium (with adherent placental tissue) at the site of umbilical attachment and fetal thymus (96 samples in total). Three contrasts were performed for the differential expression (edgeR) and network (WGCNA) analyses: UNINF v CON, INF v UNINF, and MEC v INF."	"SRA"	"partial"

Pigs (Sus scrofa) provide relevant biomedical models to dissect complex diseases due to their anatomical, genetic, and physiological similarities with humans. Aberrant DNA methylation has been linked to many of these diseases and is associated with gene expression; however, the functional similarities and differences between porcine and human DNA methylation patterns are largely unknown. DNA and RNA was isolated from eight tissue samples (fat, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, muscle, and spleen) from the adult female Duroc utilized for the pig genome sequencing project. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and RNA-seq were performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000. RRBS reads were aligned using BSseeker2, and only sites with a minimum depth of 10 reads were used for methylation analysis. RNA-seq reads were aligned using Tophat, and expression analysis was performed using Cufflinks. In addition, SNP calling was performed using GATK for targeted control and whole genome sequencing reads for CpG site validation and allelic expression analysis, respectively. These results provide transcriptional and DNA methylation datasets for the biomedical community that are directly relatable to current genomic resources. In addition, the correlation between TSS CpG density and expression suggests increased mutation rates at CpG sites play a significant role in adaptive evolution by reducing CpG density at TSS over time, resulting in higher methylation levels in these regions and more permanent changes to lower gene expression. This is proposed to occur predominantly through deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymidine, resulting in the replacement of CpG with TpG sites in these regions, as indicated by the increased TSS TpG density observed in non-expressed genes, resulting in a negative correlation between expression and TSS TpG density. This study provides baseline methylation and gene transcription profiles for a healthy adult pig, reports similar patterns to those observed in humans, and supports future porcine studies related to human disease and development. Additionally, the observed reduced CpG and increased TpG density at TSS of lowly expressed genes suggests DNA methylation plays a significant role in adaptive evolution through more permanent changes to lower gene expression."

The aim of the present study was to investigate transcriptome differences in boar testis and liver tissues with divergent androstenone levels using RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq). For this purpose, mRNA expression from testis and liver tissue samples from 10 boars, 5 samples each for high and low androstenone levels were quantified and analyzed. The results shows that in testis samples 46 genes were differentially regulated whereas 25 genes showed differential expression in the liver. Digital gene expression analysis identified genes in keratin family, desmoplakin and Interferon-induced protein family for as candidate genes for low androstenone testis sample and genes in flavin monooxygenease family, cytochrome P450 family and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family as candidate genes for low androstenone liver sample. Additionally, the results revealed that mutations in genes IRG6, DSP, IFIT2 were specific for low androstenone testis tissues and mutations in genes FMO5, HIST1H4K and TSKU were specific for low androstenone liver samples.

To characterize the complex transcriptome changes in the endometrium in the course of initial conceptus attachment deep sequencing of endometrial RNA samples of pregnant animals (n=4) and corresponding cyclic controls (n=4) was performed using Illumina RNA-Seq. The obtained sequence reads were mapped to the porcine genome and relative expression values were calculated for the analysis of differential gene expression. Statistical analysis revealed 1,933 differentially expressed genes (FDR 1%), 1,229 with higher and 704 with lower mRNA concentration in the samples from pregnant animals. Expression of selected genes was validated by the use of quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The RNA-Seq data were compared to results of a microarray study of bovine endometrium on day 18 of pregnancy and additional related data sets. Bioinformatics analysis revealed for the genes with higher mRNA concentration in pregnant samples strong overrepresentation particularly for immune-related functional terms but also for apoptosis and cell adhesion. Overrepresented terms for the genes with lower mRNA concentration in pregnant samples were related to extracellular region, ion transport, cell adhesion and lipid and steroid metabolic process. In conclusion, RNA-Seq analysis revealed comprehensive transcriptome differences in porcine endometrium between day 14 of pregnancy and corresponding cyclic endometrium and highlighted new processes and pathways probably involved in regulation of non-invasive implantation in the pig.

With this in mind, we have used massive, parallel high-throughput sequencing technologies to characterize the porcine adipose tissue transcriptome architecture in six Iberian x Landrace crossbred pigs showing extreme phenotypes for intramuscular fatty acid composition (three per group). High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to generate a whole characterization of adipose tissue (backfat) transcriptome. A total of 4,130 putative unannotated protein-coding sequences were identified in the 20% of reads which mapped in intergenic regions. Furthermore, 36% of the unmapped reads were represented by interspersed repeats, SINEs being the most abundant elements. Differential expression analyses identified 396 candidate genes among divergent animals for intramuscular fatty acid composition. Sixty-two percent of these genes (247/396) presented higher expression in the group of pigs with higher content of intramuscular SFA and MUFA, while the remaining 149 showed higher expression in the group with higher content of PUFA. Pathway analysis related these genes to biological functions and canonical pathways controlling lipid and fatty acid metabolisms. In concordance with the phenotypic classification of animals, the major metabolic pathway differentially modulated between groups was de novo lipogenesis, the group with more PUFA being the one that showed lower expression of lipogenic genes. These results will help in the identification of genetic variants at loci that affect fatty acid composition traits.

This experiment was conducted to investigate gene expression differences, transcriptional regulation and genetic polymorphisms that could be associated with the observed phenotypic differences between IB and IBxDU pigs. Nine IB and 10 IBxDU pigs were slaughtered at birth. Morphometric measures and blood samples were obtained and samples from Biceps femoris muscle were employed for compositional and transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq technology. Phenotypic differences were evident at this early age, including greater body size and weight in IBxDU and greater Biceps femoris intramuscular fat and plasma cholesterol content in IB newborns. We detected 150 differentially expressed genes between IB and IBxDU neonates (p < 0.01 and Fold-Change > 1. 5). Several were related to adipose and muscle tissues development (DLK1, FGF21 or UBC). The functional interpretation of the transcriptomic differences revealed enrichment of functions and pathways related to lipid metabolism in IB and to cellular and muscle growth in IBxDU. Protein catabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis and immune system were functions enriched in both genotypes. We identified transcription factors potentially affecting the observed gene expression differences. Some of them have known functions on adipogenesis (CEBPA, EGRs), lipid metabolism (PPARGC1B) and myogenesis (FOXOs, MEF2D, MYOD1), which suggest a key role in the meat quality differences existing between IB and IBxDU hams. We also identified several polymorphisms showing differential segregation between IB and IBxDU pigs. Among them, non-synonymous variants were detected in several transcription factors as PPARGC1B gene, which could be associated to altered gene function. Taken together, these results provide information about candidate genes, metabolic pathways and genetic polymorphisms potentially involved in phenotypic differences between IB and IBxDU associated to meat quality and production traits.

This experiment was conducted to investigate gene expression differences that could be associated with the observed phenotypic differences between IB and IBxDU pigs. Nine IB and 10 IBxDU pigs were slaughtered at birth, and seven IB and 10 IBxDU at four months of age (growing period).  Muscle transcriptome was analyzed on LD samples with RNA-Seq technology. We detected 261 differentially expressed genes between IB and IBxDU neonates and 113 at growth (p < 0.01 and Fold-Change > 1. 5). Newborns transcriptome reflected a highly proliferative developmental stage, while older pigs showed upregulation of catabolic and muscle functioning processes. Regarding the genetic type effect, IBxDU newborns showed enrichment of gene pathways involved in muscle growth, in agreement with the higher prenatal growth observed in these pigs. However, IB growing pigs showed enrichment of pathways involved in protein deposition and cellular growth, supporting the catch-up growth experienced by IB pigs during this period. Moreover, newborn and growing IB pigs showed more active glucose and lipid metabolism than IBxDU pigs. Overall design: In total 24 longissimus dorsi samples were analyzed, 6 coming from purebred Iberian male newborns and 6 coming from crossbred male newborns (IberianxDuroc), at each stage (birth and four months of age)"	"SRA"	"total"	"NA"								"GSE86441, PRJNA341938"

Unfortunately the quality of oocytes matured in vitro falls behind that of in vivo matured oocytes. To address this difference transcriptional profiling by deep sequencing was conducted on pig oocytes that were either matured in vitro or in vivo. Alignment of over 18 million reads identified 1,316 transcripts that were differentially represented. One pathway that was overrepresented in the oocytes matured in vitro was for Wingless-type MMTV integration site (WNT) signaling. In an attempt to inhibit the WNT pathway Dickkopf-related protein 1 was added to the in vitro maturation medium. Addition of Dickkopf-related protein 1 improved the percentage of oocytes that matured to the metaphase II stage, increased the number of nuclei in the resulting blastocyst stage embryos, and in oocytes reduced the amount of disheveled segment polarity protein 1 protein. It is concluded that transcriptional profiling is a powerful method for detecting differences between in vitro and in vivo matured oocytes, and that the WNT signaling pathway is important for proper oocyte maturation."

As an ideal model for animal postnatal growth studies, the Bama minipig is characterized as having a lower growth performance and fewer individual differences compared with larger pig breeds. In this study, anterior pituitaries from Bama minipig and Landrace pig were used for miRNA and mRNA expression profile analysis using miRNA microarrays and mRNA-seq. Consequently, a total of 222 miRNAs and 12,909 transcripts were detected, and both miRNAs and mRNAs in the two breeds showed high correlation (r > 0.97). Additionally, 41 differentially expressed miRNAs and 2,254 transcripts were identified. Pathways analysis indicated that 32 pathways significantly differed in the two breeds. Importantly, two GH-regulation-signalling pathways, cAMP and inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate (IP3), and multiple GH-secretion-related transcripts were significantly down-regulated in Bama minipigs. Moreover, target prediction by two algorithms (TargetScan and RNAhybrid) indicated that most miRNA-mRNA target pairs (63.68-71.33%) presented a negatively correlated expression pattern. A possible network among miRNAs, mRNAs, and GH-regulation pathways was also proposed. These data will be helpful in understanding the possible molecular mechanisms involved in animal postnatal growth.

However, the genetic mechanism underlying the phenotypic differentiation between the inflection point and asymptotic stages of the growth curve is not well characterized. Here, we employed Liangshan pigs in stages of growth at the inflection point (under inflection point: UIP) and the two asymptotic stages (before the inflection point: BIP, after the inflection point: AIP) as models to survey global gene expression in the longissimus dorsi muscle using digital gene expression (DGE) tag profiling. We found Liangshan pigs reached maximum growth rate (UIP) at 163.6 days of age and a weight of 134.6 kg. The DGE libraries generated 117 million reads of 5.89 gigabases in length. 21,331, 20,996 and 20,139 expressed transcripts were identified BIP, UIP and AIP, respectively. Among them, we identified 757 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BIP and UIP, and 271 DEGs between AIP and UIP. An enrichment analysis of DEGs proved the immune system was strengthened in the AIP stage. Energy metabolism rate, global transcriptional activity and bone development intensity were highest UIP. Meat from Liangshan pigs had the highest intramuscular fat content and most favorable fatty acid composition in the AIP. Three hundred eighty (27.70%) specific expression genes were highly enriched in QTL regions for growth and meat quality traits. This study completed a comprehensive analysis of diverse genetic mechanisms underlying the inflection point and asymptotic stages of growth. Our findings will serve as an important resource in the understanding of animal growth and development in indigenous pig breeds.

To understand some mechanisms of abnormal piglets with phenotypes such as macroglossia, standing and walking disabilities in our study and find some differences between abnormal piglets and conventionally bred normal piglets, DNA methylation profile and genome-wide gene expression were conducted in two groups, using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation binding highthroughput sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) and RNA sequencing(RNA-Seq). We generated and provided a genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profile for abnormal cloned and conventionally bred piglets. We detected a total of 1493 genes differentially expressed in two groups and 382 of these genes also differentially methylated in two groups. Analysis of relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression revealed that DNA methylation levels had significantly negative and monotonic correlation with gene expression levels in particular regions of genes while no obvious monotonic correlation in other regions. Besides, we found some interesting genes and pathways such as MYH7 and mTOR signalling pathway that may played essential role in muscle growth and development. Briefly, these results provide reliable data for future epigenetic studies and may help to uncover the mechanism of failure clones via SCNT.

Little is known however about the molecular mechanisms underlying differences in sperm DNA fragmentation and an understanding of the genes controlling this sperm parameter could help in selecting the best boars for AI use. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes in testis of Norsvin Landrace and Duroc boars with good and bad sperm DNA fragmentation using transcriptome sequencing and to use the data for polymorphism search. RNA sequence reads were obtained using Illumina technology and mapped by TopHat using the Ensembl pig database. Differentially expressed genes and pathways were analyzed using the R Bioconductor packages edgeR and goseq respectively. Using a false discovery rate of 0.05, 309 and 375 genes were found displaying significant differences in expression level between the good and bad condition in Landrace and Duroc respectively. Of the differentially expressed genes, 72 were found in common for the two breeds. Gene ontology analysis revealed that terms common for the two breeds included extracellular matrix, extracellular region and calcium ion binding. Additionally, different metabolic processes were enriched in Landrace and Duroc, whereas immune response ontologies were found to be important in Landrace. SNP detection in Landrace/Duroc identified 53182/53931 variants in 10924/10748 transcripts and of these, 1573/1827 SNPs occurred in 189/241 unique genes that were also differentially expressed. Possible high impact variants were detected using SnpEff. Transcriptome sequencing identified differentially expressed genes and nucleotide variants related to differences in sperm DNA fragmentation, and functional annotation of the genes pointed towards important biochemical pathways. This study provides insights into the genetic network underlying this trait and is a first step towards using sperm DNA fragmentation for predicting boar fertility.

The objective of this study was to identify changes in the pig liver transcriptome induced by a diet enriched with omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, and to characterize the biological mechanisms related to PUFA metabolism. Polish Landrace pigs (n =12) were fed diet enriched with linoleic acid (LA, omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, omega-3 family) or standard diet as a control. The fatty acids profiling was assayed in order to verify how feeding influenced the fatty acids content in liver, and subsequently next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) between transcriptomes between dietary groups. The biological mechanisms and pathway interaction networks were identified by analysis in DAVID and Cytoscape tools. Fatty acids profile analysis indicated a higher contribution of PUFAs in liver for LA and ALA-enriched diet group, particularly for the omega-3 fatty acids family, but not omega-6. Next-generation sequencing identified 3,565 DEG, 1,484 of which were induced and 2,081 were suppressed by PUFA supplemenation. Low ratio of omega-6/-3 fatty acids resulted in modulation of fatty acids metabolism pathways and over-representation of genes involved in membrane composition, signal transduction and immune response pathways. In conclusion, a diet enriched with omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids altered the transcriptomic profile of the pig liver and affected a set of genes involved in metabolic pathways important to animal health status. Overall design: Hepatic mRNA profiles of Polish Landrace pig breed fed two different diets, were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina MiSeq.

When compared with Western commercial pig breeds, Chinese indigenous pig breeds exhibited slower growth rates and reduced lean meat content but superior perceived meat quality. To study the factors that determine meat quality, we examined piglets of one Western commercial breed (Yorkshire) and one Chinese indigenous breed (Wannanhua) and sequenced the longissimus dorsi muscle using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We analyzed their transcriptomes, focusing on identifying candidate genes that may influence porcine muscle growth, meat quality and adipose deposition. Gene ontology functional enrichment and pathway enrichment analyses identified differentially expressed genes primarily associated with glycolytic metabolism, biological processes of muscle development and signaling pathways related to fatty acid metabolism, growth and carcass traits. This finding suggests that the differentially expressed genes may play important roles in determining meat quality traits. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed the differential expression of twelve selected differentially expressed genes.

Some documented evidences proved small RNAs (sRNA) and targeted genes are involved in mammalian testicular development and spermatogenesis. However, the detailed molecular regulation mechanisms of them remain largely unknown so far. We used the deep sequencing technology to characterize and identify the similarities and diversities of the expression and regulation of mRNAs, miRNAs and piRNAs which are possibly related to spermatogenesis and testicular development in different pig breeds at different stages of sexual maturity. In this study, we obtained a total of 10,716 mRNAs, 67 miRNAs and 16,953 piRNAs which were differentially expressed between LC and LW pig breeds or between the two sexual maturity stages. Of which, we identified 16 miRNAs and 28 targeted genes possibly related to spermatogenesis; 14 miRNAs and 18 targeted genes probably associated with cell adhesion related testis development. We also annotated 579 piRNAs which could potentially regulate cell death, nucleosome organization and other basic biology process, which implied that those piRNAs might be involved in sexual maturation difference. The integrated network analysis results suggested that some differentially expressed genes were involved in spermatogenesis through the ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, Wnt and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, some particular miRNAs have the negative regulation roles and some special piRNAs have the positive and negative regulation roles in testicular development. Our data provide novel insights into the molecular expression and regulation similarities and diversities of spermatogenesis and testicular development in different pig breeds at different stages of sexual maturity. Overall design: LC and LW boars considerably differ in sexual maturation time; LW boars reach maturity at ~180 days old (Egbunike 1979), whereas LC boars reach maturity at 90 days old (Huang Ya-qiong et al. 2013).

The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in the muscle transcriptome and the biological functions regulated by increased consumption of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in the pig gluteus medius muscle. The transcriptome of the gluteus medius muscle was studied for pigs subjected to either a control diet or a diet supplemented with linseed and rapeseed oil to increase polyunsaturated fatty acid content. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to generate the muscle tissue transcriptome database. The results of the NGS indicate a role of the fatty acids in the regulation of the expression of genes essential for muscle tissue development and functioning. Functional analysis revealed that the identified genes were important for a number of biological processes including protein development, signaling, inflammatory response, membranes, and lipid metabolism. The genes that were expressed specifically in only one of the dietary groups were responsible for many of the same processes listed above, indicating that biological processes were strongly modulated and tended to switch between coherent stages in response to increased levels of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids. Several nuclear receptors regulating transcription showed altered expression, including hepatocyte nuclear factor-4a (HNF4alpha), carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP), and nuclear factor ?B (NFkappa?). We suggest that the identified changes were largely due to regulation of those transcription factors. Our results provide strong evidence that n-6 and n-3 fatty acids regulate fundamental metabolic processes in muscle tissue development and functioning.

Functional analyses with DEGs revealed that the lipid metabolism (SCD and FASN) was one of the significant biological processes related with IMF content determination. In addition, we also found that DEGs related with muscle regeneration (MYOG and VEGFA) and extracellular matrix (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL5A1, COL14A1, and COL15A1) were changed between individuals with the extreme IMF contents, interestingly. These results will aid in understanding the regulation of IMF contents in pigs.

Red color skin is the first trait fixed in goldfish and distinguished from its ancestor. However, the genomic resources about the speices is limited when performing the study, which heavely hampers our understanding of the genetic basis of the diverse phenotypes. To quickly provide a large amount of genomic resources and decipher the possible mechanism underlying diverse color skin in goldfish, We performed a large scale of transcriptome sequencing on 13 tissues and 4 typical color skins through combinng PacBio long-read sequencing and Illumina short-read sequencing. A full-length transcriptome with 137,674 transcripts was generated with mean length and N50 length of 2,956 bp and 4,017 bp, respectively. A total of 108,122 (78.53%) novel isoforms from known genes and 17,622 novel genes were identified compared to the annotation of recently published goldfish reference genome. Moreover, 59,014 alternative splicing events were present in 15,380 genes. A total of 162 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among the four different color skins, which were mainly involved in the pathways of Melanogenesis, Tyrosine metabolism, Riboflavin metabolism, Folate biosynthesis, and alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism. Fourteen DEGs may have function in pigmentation, including Melanophilin genes, solute carrier family 2 member 11 and solute carrier family 2 member 9. In conclusion, the genomic resources provided in study significantly improved the gene annotation of the published referecne genome and enhanced the understanding of the goldfish pigmentation pathways and will finally facilitate future studies on genetic basis of goldfish diverse phenotypes."

However, an obstacle to these methods in many mammalian species is the presence of reticulocyte-derived globin mRNAs in large quantities, which can complicate RNA-seq library sequencing and impede detection of other mRNA transcripts. Here, we use comparative analyses of published RNA-seq data sets from human, porcine, and equine peripheral blood, in addition to bovine data generated by us, to systematically assess the impact of globin mRNA on routine transcriptome profiling of whole blood in cattle and horses. Bovine peripheral blood was collected into Tempus blood RNA tubes and total RNA was subsequent extracted. Ten paired-end 2 x 100 bp RNA-seq libraries were generated and then sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform over five lanes.The results of these analyses demonstrate that total RNA isolated from equine and bovine peripheral blood contains very low levels of globin mRNA transcripts, thereby negating the need for globin depletion and greatly simplifying blood-based transcriptomics studies in these two domestic species."

Pigs with low RFI have reduced feed intake. Based on the resource allocation theory, we hypothesize that these low RFI pigs might have compromised immune response to immune stimulation. To test this hypothesis, twenty eight gilts of initial body weight (BW) of 63 +/- 4 kg from pigs selected for low RFI and high RFI were randomly selected for the ISU RFI selection project and utilized in two replicates (14 pigs/replicate) for this study. All pigs were housed in individual metabolism pens, had free access to water and were fed a corn-soy-based diet twice daily, and feed restricted (1.5 kg/day) as previously described. After a 9-day adaptation period pigs were randomly assigned within line to either a control (n = 6, three pigs per line) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge (n = 8, 4 pigs per line) group. Pigs in the challenge group were then repeatedly challenged with an intramuscular injection of 30, 36, 39, and 42 microg/kg BW of LPS from E. coli O5:B5 (sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in saline solution at time points 0, 48, 96, and 144 hours post initial injection (hpi) to compensate for LPS tolerance after initial injection, respectively, while animals in the control group were injected with an equivalent volume of saline solution at the equivalent time points. Rectal temperatures of individual pigs were measured immediately before the initial injection (serving as baseline, called *0 hpi* for convenience), and 2, 4, 6, and 24 hpi, and 0, 4, 24 hours after each subsequent injection for all pigs. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein into TempusTM Blood RNA tubes (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for long-term storage at -80°C, EDTA tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) for CBC tests and serum tubes for cytokine assays at 0, 2, 6, 24 and 168 hpi. At 168 hpi, all pigs were euthanized via barbiturate overdose, exsanguinated and tissue samples including the longissimus dorsi muscle, liver, spleen, and ileum were isolated, cleaned an frozen for later use. This study only focused on samples and data collected for the first 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted from the 32 blood samples of the treatment group in Replicate 2, collected at 0, 2, 6, and 24 hpi, by using preserved blood RNA purification kit I (Norgen Biotek Corp, Thorold, Ontario) per manufacturer's instruction. On-column DNA digestion was performed as described using DNase I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Globin transcripts (HBB and HBA) were depleted by following an RNase H-mediated method.

This effort has extended previous gene profiling efforts by the identification of thousands of transcripts not previously reported to exist in these tissues, hundreds of which exhibit daily rhythms in abundance. Gene expression appears to occur in four waves, peaking at distinct times during the 24 hour period. In this study animals were kept in constant darkness with the intention of identifying changes that occur as a function of the internal clock, not as a function of environmental lighting. Accordingly, the rhythmic changes identified are likely to be truly circadian in nature and to be either part of the biological clock or to be clock controlled genes. Ontological analysis of the tissue enriched transcripts and of the rhythmically expressed transcript revealed that many are linked to visual transduction, circadian clock function and melatonin synthesis. The findings of this report will be of significant value in future studies of the genetic basis of pineal and retinal function.

Reads were aligned using STAR aligner and differential expression was asssessed using DESeq2. Results: We discover a variety of genes that show circadian activivty in human pineal gland. Conclusions: Our study represents part of a comparative analysis of pineal gland transcriptome of several species, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of mRNA content within a cell or tissue. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions. Overall design: Pineal glands were obtained from NDRI (National Disease Research Interchange), (Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA). Two glands were from individuals that died at mid-day (11:00-13:00) and four from deaths occurring at mid-night (23:00-01:00). Samples were stored at -80 o C until use. RNA was extracted from individual glands with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,CA) and subsequently cleaned up using an RNeasy Micro Kit with on-column DNase treatment(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The amount and quality of RNA were determined using a NanoDropspectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE) and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (AgilentTechnologies, Santa Clara, CA), respectively. RIN values ranged from 7.3-8.7. RNA-Seq library preparation and sequencing: Ribosomal-depleted RNA was used to construct stranded libraries from 1 microg aliquots of total RNA using a TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina cat. no. RS-122- 2301) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The library insert sizes were approximately 170 bp. Unique barcode adapters were appended to each library. Equal volumes of individual libraries were pooled and run on a MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The libraries were then re-pooled based on the MiSeq demultiplexing results. The pooled libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using version 4 chemistry. The data was processed using RTA version 1.18.64 and CASAVA 1.8.2. This yielded an average of 81 million 126-bp read-pairs for each sample. Reads were aligned using STAR aligner and differential expression was asssessed using DESeq2. GRCh37/hg19 genome build with Gencode 19 annotation was used."	"SRA"	"total"	"circadian (SNE-NICHD)"								"PRJNA391921, GSE100472"

Enclosed in this accession is the RNA-seq data for the 12 new human testis and epididymis segment samples we processed for analysis. Overall design: The de novo isolated human testes and epididymides included in this study were obtained from three donors through a local organ transplant program in Quebec, Canada called Transplant Quebec. All procedures were approved by the local ethics committee and written consent was obtained from each respective donor's family. The donors were of 40, 52, and 65 years of age with no preexisting medical condition that could affect reproductive function. Donor testes and epididymides were removed under artificial circulation to preserve other organs that were assigned for transplantation. Each testis and epididymis were dissected in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Sullivan at University Laval. Each epididymis was dissected into three segments corresponding to the caput, corpus and cauda regions and minced into small tissue pieces. Testes and epididymides tissue fragments were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at -80°C, and shipped frozen to the laboratory of Dr. Thomas Garcia at Baylor College of Medicine for further processing."

"SRP049818"	"RNA-Seq of the rat pineal transcriptome, with in-vivo and in-vitro samples, under various treatment and surgical conditions"	"Pineal function follows a 24-hour schedule, dedicated to the conversion of night and day into a hormonal signal, melatonin. In mammals, 24-hour changes in pineal activity are controlled by a neural pathway that includes the central circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the superior cervical ganglia (SCG), which innervate the pineal gland. In this study, we have generated the first next-generation RNA sequencing evidence of neural control of the daily changes in the pineal transcriptome. We found over 3000 pineal transcripts that are differentially expressed (p <0.001) on a night/day basis (70% of these genes increase at night, 376 with fold change >4 or <1/4), the majority of which had not been previously identified as such. Nearly all night/day differences were eliminated by neonatal removal or decentralization of the SCG, confirming the importance of neural input for differential night/day changes in transcript abundance. In contrast, very few non-rhythmic genes showed evidence of changes in expression due to the surgical procedure itself, which is consistent with the hypothesis that post neonatal neural stimulation is not required for cell fate determination and maintenance of phenotype. Many of the transcripts that exhibit marked differential night/day expression exhibited similar changes in response to in vitro treatment with norepinephrine, the SCG neurotransmitter which mediates pineal regulation. Similar changes were also seen following treatment with an analog of the norepinephrine second messenger, cyclic AMP. Overall design: For the in vivo data, there were 8 biological conditions: day and night time points for each of four surgical groups: Control (Ctrl) Sham-surgery (Sham), Decentralized (DCN), and Ganglionectomized (SCGX). Samples were pooled into three biological replicates for each biological condition. For the in vitro data there were 3 biological conditions: Untreated control (CN), DBcAMP-treated (DB), and Norepinephrine-treated (NE). For the pineal enrichment comparison, three samples (i.e. no biological replicates) were used: pineal-day, pineal-night and mixed-tissue. For the mixed tissues sample, the following tissues from three rats sacrificed at ZT7 were used: cortex, cerebellum, midbrain, hypothalamus, hindbrain, spinal cord, retina, pituitary, heart, liver, lung, kidney, skeletal muscle, small intestine, adrenal gland. Total RNA was extracted from each tissue, and then equal amounts of each of the 15 tissues were combined for the final pooled sample."

To this end, we employed tissue-to-tissue and tissue-specific network approaches using the genome-wide expression profile of 14 samples for two experimental conditions [Control - CON (n = 7) and 40% nutrient restriction - RES (n = 7)]. After RNA quality control, read mapping was performed with STAR aligner to the bovine ARS-UCD1.2 reference genome. Count normalization was performed by using the VST function from DESEq2. Gene networks were constructed using the PCIT algorithm, whereas differentially co-expressed genes were identified based on the R-package DGCA. Significant gene-gene co-expression was taken based on r > | 0.9| and then filtered by differentially expressed genes and transcription factors. Networks were visualized in Cytoscape, and functional analyses were carried out on Cluego and ShinyGo tools. We found that the cerebrum, liver, and muscle tissues were affected by nutrient restriction leading to differences in transcriptional regulation between CON and RES groups. Furthermore, we shed light on the nutrient-sensing pathways across tissues such as mTOR, PI3K/Akt, and insulin.

As cell and tissue engineering is reliant on specific molecular markers to discriminate between cell types, tendon-specific genes need to be identified. In order to accomplish this, we have used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare gene expression between tendon, bone, cartilage and ligament from horses. We identified several tendon-selective gene markers, and established eyes absent homolog 2 (EYA2) and G-protein regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 3 (GPRIN3) as specific tendon markers using RT-qPCR. Equine tendon cells cultured as three dimensional spheroids expressed significantly greater levels of EYA2 than GPRIN3, and stained positively for EYA2 using immunohistochemistry. EYA2 was also found in fibroblast-like cells within the tendon tissue matrix and in cells localized to the vascular endothelium. We have identified EYA2 and GPRIN3 as specific molecular markers of equine tendon as compared to bone, cartilage and ligament, and provide evidence for the use of EYA2 as an additional marker for tendon cells in vitro."

Methods: Out of 120 broiler chickens fed either CONTROL feed or AGP feed (supplemented with avilamycin; Surmax 100, 10 g/1000 kg of feed, Elanco), the RNA from the ileum tissue of five birds per group was isolated from day 35, profiled by RNA-sequencing, and results were verified via RT-qPCR. Results: Overall, 66 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; FDR = 0.05 and fold change = 2 or = -2) were found in the ileum of chicken fed avilamycin in comparison to the control group. Only partial agreement was found on the DEGs (64%) when the reads were initially mapped to the former genome assembly Galgal5 instead of GRCg6a. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the down-regulated DEGs were associated with signaling by interleukins, and that IL-22 and certain antimicrobial peptides could play a central role in the intestinal host response to avilamycin at day 35. This was further corroborated on sixteen chickens per group via RT-qPCR. In addition, higher activity was detected in module of genes related to lipid metabolism and transport in the avilamycin group, as revealed by the co-expression network analysis. Conclusions: Improved feed efficiency was correlated with reduced immunological stress in the intestinal mucosa. The RNA-Seq approach allowed generating novel knowledge that could contribute to the development of AGP alternatives, with IL-22 identified as a potential marker. Overall design: Ileum mRNA profiles from 35 day old chickens. For each tissue, 5 biological replicates (= 5 chickens) from Control and 5 from Avilamycin group were used for RNA-extraction. Two technical replicates of each of the biological replicates were used for library preparation.

"SRP249850"	"Rodents as models of human sarcopenia: a comparative analysis reveals conserved modulators of aging-dependent muscle loss"	"Aims: Sarcopenia is the degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass and function at high age, which affects 5-13% of people aged 60-70 years. Although a number of factors have been linked to sarcopenia, it remains unclear what determines its emergence in some but not all individuals and there are no medical treatments available. Mice and rats are widely used as model organisms to identify factors predisposing to sarcopenia, but the extent to which age-related molecular changes in wild-type mice and rats recapitulate those occurring in humans is not known. The aim of this project was to define a conserved set of regulators of aging-related reduction in muscle function that could be targeted by future therapies. Methods: We comparatively analyzed phenotypic parameters as well as the transcriptomes of the Gastrocnemius muscle from mice, rats and humans of a wide range of ages. We further inferred computationally the transcription regulators that likely underlie the molecular changes associated with aging-related loss in muscle functionality. Results: The analysis showed that the biological age of rodents that muscle mass is a better indicator of muscle functionality than the chronological age. Investigating the molecular changes associated with the aging-related loss of muscle mass, we discovered changes in gene expression that are shared between the studied species at the level of molecular pathways rather than at the level of individual genes. Beyond the known involvement of inflammation and mitochondrial function in aging, we found that the transcription regulators SPIB, ESRRB and YY1/YY2 consistently underlie aging-related molecular changes across the studied species. Conclusions: Rodents recapitulate well the molecular changes observed in human sarcopenia, but the conservation is stronger at the molecular pathway level than at the level of individual genes. Phenotypic parameters such as the muscle mass should be taken into account in stratifying samples for analyzing aging-related processes, as the chronological age is a poorer indicator of organ functionality. The shared regulators of aging-related muscle loss that we identified here can be studied further in rodent models of sarcopenia toward defining new targets for therapy in humans. Overall design: Gastrocnemius muscle mRNA profiles of 8, 18, 22, 24, 26 and 28 months old wild type mice were generated by next-generation sequencing."

"SRP226516"	"The neuromuscular junction is a focal point of mTORC1 signaling in sarcopenia [Aging-Rapamycin data set]."	"Purpose: Despite demonstrating that the overall effect of long-term rapamycin-treatment is overwhelmingly positive in aging skeletal muscle, we observed muscle-specificity in the responsiveness to rapamycin, leading us to hypothesize that the primary drivers of age-related muscle loss and therefore effective intervention strategies may differ between muscles. To address this question and dissect the key signaling nodes associated with mTORC1-driven muscle aging, we created a comprehensive multi-muscle gene expression atlas in adult, sarcopenic and rapamycin-treated mice using RNA-seq. Methods: To examine the impact of long-term rapamycin treatment, male C57BL/6 mice were fed encapsulated rapamycin incorporated into a standardized AIN93M diet at 42 ppm (i.e. mg per kg of food), corresponding to a dose of ~4 mg.kg-1.day-1, from 15- to 30-months of age. This dose of rapamycin has been shown to extend lifespan maximally in male C57BL/6 mice. We performed RNA-seq on gastrocnemius (GAS), tibialis anterior (TA), triceps brachii (TRI) and soleus (SOL) muscles from each of six mice for 10m, 30m and 30mRM groups. The four muscle types were chosen to encompass fore- and hindlimb locations (e.g. TRI and GAS); slow and fast contraction properties (e.g. SOL and GAS); anterior and posterior positioning (e.g. TA and GAS) and the extent of protection by rapamycin (TA and TRI: protected; SOL: partiallly protected; GAS: not protected). Results: Age-related gene expression changes were remarkably consistent across the four different muscles, varying only in magnitude. Despite having the smallest age-related muscle loss of the four muscles, TA had the strongest age-related gene expression response which was associated with an increased reinnervation response. Despite the strong between-muscle commonality of age-related changes, gene expression responses to prolonged rapamycin treatment differed substantially between muscles. Rapamycin partially reversed many age-related changes in mRNA expression in the TA and TRI, but not in SOL or GAS muscle. Principle component analysis (PCA) showed that rapamycin had common 'anti-aging' effects on all muscles, while also exerting muscle-specific pro-aging effects on muscles not protected by rapamycin. Conclusions: Sustained, muscle fiber-specific mTORC1 activity drives sarcopenia-like gene expression programs, and the hyperactive mTORC1 seen in sarcopenic muscle may therefore contribute to sarcopenia. Overall design: Skeletal muscle mRNA profiles of 10 and 30 months old wild type mice and mice daily treated with rapamycin for 15 months from the age of 15 months were generated by next-generation sequencing."

"SRP226514"	"The neuromuscular junction is a focal point of mTORC1 signaling in sarcopenia [NMJ data set]."	"Purpose: To investigate whether our signatures of mTORC1-driven sarcopenia originate from cells residing at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), we followed laser-capture microdissection with RNA-seq from adult and sarcopenic tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Methods: TA muscles were incubated in solution containing fluorescently-labeled bungarotoxin, which binds to post-synaptic AChRs and thereby marks NMJ regions. Approximately 300 synaptic regions (NMJ) and a comparable number of extra-synaptic (xNMJ) regions were collected from 30microM thick sections using laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and processed for RNA-seq. Results: As compared to xNMJ regions, NMJ regions were highly enriched for genes known to be specifically expressed at the NMJ. The analysis demonstrated that genes associated with sarcopenia are significantly enriched at the NMJ in young (10 months) and old (30 months) mice. Furthermore, the age-related reduction in expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling was particularly prominent in NMJ regions but not in xNMJ regions. Conclusions: Diminished expression of ECM genes at the NMJ may impact the stability of the NMJ and its ability to remodel following common age-related remodelling events such as muscle fiber degeneration/regeneration and motor unit loss. Overall design: mRNA profiles of synaptic and extra-synaptic regions of skeletal muscles of 10 and 30 months old wild type mice by next-generation sequencing."

As disease-modifying therapies are not available, novel therapeutic targets need to be discovered and prioritized for their importance in mediating the abnormal phenotype of cells in OA-affected joints. Here, we generated a genome-wide molecular profile of OA to elucidate regulatory mechanisms of OA pathogenesis and to identify possible therapeutic targets using integrative analysis of mRNA-sequencing data obtained from human knee cartilage. Methods:RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on 18 normal and 20 OA human knee cartilage tissues. RNA-seq datasets were analysed to identify genes, pathways and regulatory networks that were dysregulated in OA. Results:RNA-seq data analysis revealed 1332 differentially expressed (DE) genes between OA and non-OA samples, including known and novel transcription factors (TFs). Pathway analysis identified 15 significantly perturbed pathways in OA with ECM-related, PI3K-Akt, HIF-1, FoxO and circadian rhythm pathways being the most significantly dysregulated. We selected differentially expressed TFs that are enriched for regulating DE genes in OA and prioritized these transcription factors by creating a cartilage-specific interaction subnetwork. This analysis revealed 8 TFs, including JUN, EGR1, JUND, FOSL2, MYC, KLF4, RELA, and FOS that both target large numbers of dysregulated genes in OA and are themselves suppressed in OA. Conclusion:We identified a novel subnetwork of dysregulated TFs that represent new mediators of abnormal gene expression and promising therapeutic targets in OA.

At post-mortem there are cortical regions that range from mildly to severely affected by tau pathology and neuronal loss. A comparison of the molecular signatures of these differentially affected areas within cases and between cases and controls may allow the temporal modelling of disease progression. Here we used RNA sequencing to explore differential gene expression in the mildly affected primary visual cortex and moderately affected precuneus of ten age-, gender- and RNA quality-matched post-mortem brains from AD patients and healthy controls. The two regions in AD cases had similar transcriptomic signatures but there were broader abnormalities in the precuneus consistent with the greater tau load. Both regions were characterised by upregulation of immune-related genes such as those encoding triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 and membrane spanning 4-domains A6A and milder changes in insulin/IGF1 signalling. The precuneus in AD was also characterised by changes in vesicle secretion and downregulation of the interneuronal subtype marker, somatostatin. The 'early' AD transcriptome is characterised by perturbations in synaptic vesicle secretion on a background of neuroimmune dysfunction.

Here, focusing on the lateral amygdala, a major brain site for emotional homeostasis, we described molecular cross-talk among multiple epigenetic mechanisms, including 6 histone marks, DNA methylation and the transcriptome, in subjects with a history of ELA and controls. We first uncovered, in the healthy brain, previously unknown interactions among epigenetic layers, in particular related to non-CG methylation in the CAC context. We then showed that ELA associates with methylomic changes that are as frequent in the CAC as in the canonical CG context, while these two forms of plasticity occur in sharply distinct genomic regions, features, and chromatin states. Combining these multiple data indicated that immune-related and small GTPase signaling pathways are most consistently impaired in the amygdala of ELA individuals.

Although decapod systematics have received much study, limitations of morphological and Sanger sequence data have yet to produce a consensus for higher-level relationships. Here we introduce a new anchored hybrid enrichment kit for decapod phylogenetics designed from genomic and transcriptomic sequences that we used to capture new high-throughput sequence data from 94 species, including 58 of 179 extant decapod families, and 11 of 12 major lineages. The enrichment kit yields 410 loci (>86,000 bp) conserved across all lineages of Decapoda, eight times more molecular data than any prior study. Phylogenomic analyses recover a robust decapod tree of life strongly supporting the monophyly of all infraorders, and monophyly of each of the reptant, 'lobster', and 'crab' groups, with some results supporting pleocyemate monophyly. We show that crown decapods diverged in the Late Ordovician and most crown lineages diverged in the Triassic-Jurassic, highlighting a cryptic Paleozoic history, and post-extinction diversification.

"SRP241627"	"Transcriptomes from four species of decapod crustaceans: Panulirus argus, Homarus americanus, Procambarus clarkii, and Callinectes sapidus"	"Crustaceans express at least three classes of putative chemosensory proteins. These are: Ionotropic Receptors (IRs), derived from the heterotetrameric ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs); Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels, a diverse set of sensor-channels that include several families of chemosensory channels; and Gustatory Receptor-Like receptors (GRLs), which are ionotropic receptors that are homologues of Gustatory Receptors (GRs) of insects and are expressed sparingly in most decapod crustaceans studied so far. IRs are typically numerically the most dominant of these receptor proteins in crustaceans and include two classes: four co-receptor IRs, which are necessary for making a functional receptor-channel; and tuning IRs, whose specific combination in the IR subunits in the heterotetramer confers specific chemical specificity. In order to study the expression of these families of chemosensory proteins in decapod crustaceans, we examined and compared the transcriptomes from two major chemosensory organs - the lateral flagellum of the antennules (LF) and the tips of the legs (dactyls) - of the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus, the clawed lobster Homarus americanus, the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii, and the blue crab Callinectes sapidus. We also compared the transcriptomes generated from the brains of P. argus, H. americanus, and P. clarkii.

The IRs show different degrees of phylogenetic conservation: some are arthropod-conserved, others are pancrustacean-conserved, others appear to be crustacean-conserved, and some appear to be species-specific. Many IRs appear to be more highly expressed in the LF than dactyl or brain. Our research shows that decapod crustaceans have an abundance of chemosensory proteins of different types, phylogenetic conservation, and expression patterns. An understanding of their functional roles awaits determining their expression patterns in individual chemosensory neurons and the central projections of those neurons."

Methods: Total RNA was extracted and purified from five tissues using the RiboZero Gold kit. Sequencing libraries were prepared with a KAPA Stranded RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit following the Illumina paired-end library preparation protocol. Completed libraries were sequenced on HiSeq 2000 as 100 bp paired-end reads at the Australian Cancer Research Foundation (ACRF) Cancer Genomics Facility, Adelaide, Australia and USDA-ARS-US Meat Animal Research Center, Clay Center, USA. Approximately 60 million 100 bp single-end reads were obtained for each sample. Reads were aligned to the cattle reference genome UOA_brahman_1/UOA_angus_1 and mapped to known genomic features at the gene level using the Hisat2. Single reads were then summarized into gene-level counts using FeatureCounts. Overall design: We used animals and semen of Angus (Bos taurus taurus) and Brahman (Bos taurus indicus) cattle, subsequently referred as Bt and Bi respectively. Pure Bt and Bi females of approximately 16-20 months of age were maintained on pasture supplemented with silage. Fetuses produced by artificial insemination with semen of pure bred Bt or Bi sires. Cows were pregnancy tested by ultrasound scanning. Cows and fetuses were humanely sacrificed by stunning and exsanguination at day 153+/- 1 of gestation. Fetuses were dissected, tissues snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC study as previously described (Xiang et al., 2013). Five of the tissues were used in this study: Brain, Liver, Lung, Muscle and Placenta. Three male and three female fetus from each of the 4 genetic types (Bt x Bt; Bi x Bt; Bt x Bi; Bi x Bi; paternal genome listed first) were used in this study for a total of 24 samples per tissue."

Engineering CHO gene expression thus holds a key to improve drug quality and cost effective production. However, the success of engineering gene expression or ectopic activation of silent genes to optimize desired pathways requires accurate annotation of the underlying regulatory elements and the transcription start site (TSS). Unfortunately, to date, most TSSs of CHO-expressed genes and the ~50% of hamster genes that are silent in CHO were computationally predicted and are frequently inaccurate. To oust this hurdle, we report revised TSSs annotations for 15,308 Chinese Hamster genes and 4,145 non-coding RNAs based on experimental data from CHO K1 cells and 10 hamster tissues. In the example of the glycosyltransferase gene Mgat3, we further demonstrate how accurate annotations readily facilitate activating silent genes by CRISPRa. Together, we envision that our annotation and data from the Chinese Hamster will provide a rich resource for the CHO community, improve genome engineering efforts and additionally aid comparative and evolutionary studies.

In this study, the NGS sequencing of RNA (RNA-Seq) method was employed to obtain the whole transcriptome of cardiac tissues from transplant recipients with advanced stage of HF. The analysis of RNA-Seq data presents novel challenges and many methods have been developed for the purpose of mapping reads to genomic features and quantifying gene expression. The main goal of this work was to identify, characterize and catalogue all the transcripts expressed within cardiac tissue and to quantify the differential expression of transcripts in both physio- and pathological conditions through whole transcriptome analyses. Expression levels, differential splicing, allele-specific expression, RNA editing and fusion transcripts constitute important information when comparing samples for disease related studies. Analysis methods for RNA-Seq data are continuing to evolve. Thus, in order to find the best solution for filter generated list of differentially expressed genes, an informatic approach of NOISeq BIO method has been applied in this RNA-Seq analysis. Most of the genes obtained by filtering differentially expressed gene list, have been experimentally validated by Real time RT-PCR. Noteworthy, these findings provide valuable resources for further studies of the molecular mechanisms involved in heart ischemic response thus leading to potential novel biomarkers and targets for therapeutic intervention in the onset and progression of cardiomyopathies.

Yet, in spite of the evidence accumulated in the past decade that regulatory changes contribute to many species-specific adaptations, we still know remarkably little about the mechanisms of regulatory evolu tion. In this study we focused on DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism whose contribution to the evolution of gene expression remains unclear. To interrogate the methylation status of the vast majority of cytosines in the genome, we performed whole-genome bisulfite conversion followed by high-throughput sequencing across 4 tissues (heart, kidney, liver and lung) in 3 primate species (human, chimpanzee and macaque). In parallel, we collected gene expression profiles using RNA-seq from the same tissue samples, allowing us to perform a high resolution scan for genes and pathways whose regulation evolved under natural selection. We integrated these datasets to characterize better the genome features whose methylation status leads to expression changes, and we developed a statistical model to quantify the proportion of variation in gene expression levels across tissues and species.

"SRP265144"	"Gene expression variability in human and chimpanzee populations share common determinants"	"Inter-individual variation in gene regulation has been shown to be heritable and it is quite often associated with differences in disease susceptibility between individuals. While many human studies focused on mapping associations between genetic and gene regulatory variation, much less attention has been paid to the evolutionary processes that shape the observed differences in gene regulation between individuals in humans or any other primate. To begin addressing this gap, we performed a comparative expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping study in humans and chimpanzees, using gene expression data from primary heart samples. While expression variability in both species is strongly determined by non-genetic sources, such as cell type heterogeneity, we found evidence that the degree of inter-individual variation in gene regulation is generally conserved in humans and chimpanzees. In particular, we found a significant overlap of genes associated with eQTLs in the two species. We conclude that humans and chimpanzees share sources common determinants of gene expression variability, including genetically regulated constraints from stabilizing and diversifying selection pressures. Overall design: 38 chimpanzee primary heart tissues samples subjected to RNA-seq. One replicate per individual.

Yet the relationship with long-term clinical outcomes remains unclear. Objective: We evaluated transcriptome alterations in AT during LCD and association with weight and glycemic outcomes both at LCD termination and 6-month after the LCD. Results: Upon LCD, we identified 1'173 genes differentially expressed; with 350 and 33 genes associated respectively with changes in BMI and Matsuda. Twenty-nine genes were associated with both endpoints. Pathway analyses highlighted enrichment in lipid and glucose metabolism. Models were constructed to predict weight maintainers. A model based on clinical baseline parameters could not achieve any prediction (validation's AUC= 0.50 [0.36, 0.64]), while a model based on clinical changes during LCD yielded to good performance (AUC=0.73 [0.60, 0.87]). Incorporating baseline expression from the 18 genes outperformed the best clinical model (AUC=0.87 [0.77, 0.96], Delong's p=0.012). Similar analyses were made to predict subjects with good glycemic improvements. Both baseline- and LCD-based clinical models yielded to similar performance (with best AUC=0.73 [0.60, 0.85]). Addition of expression changes during LCD improved substantially the performance (AUC=0.80 [0.69, 0.92], p=0.058). Conclusions: This study investigated AT transcriptome alterations following LCD in a large cohort of obese, non-diabetic patients. The identified genes enabled to significantly improve clinical models and predict long-term clinical outcomes. These biomarkers may help clinicians understanding the large inter-subject variability and better predict the success of dietary interventions.

Generating cortex, lung, liver and muscle tissue transcriptomes of 16 mice of different ages, covering development and ageing periods, we found that expression reversals were widespread but tissue-specific. Consistent with this result, we observed an inter-tissue divergence during development and convergence during ageing (DiCo), further confirmed in independent mouse and human datasets. The genes displaying DiCo pattern were enriched among tissue-specific genes that tended to lose developmental expression levels during ageing. Finally, analysing publicly available single-cell transcriptome data, we studied the contribution of cellular composition and cell-autonomous changes to the convergence in ageing. Our results, for the first time, suggest inter-tissue convergence during ageing is widespread and associated with the loss of specialisation at the tissue and possibly also at the cellular level. Overall design: Age-series mRNA expression profiles from 4 tissues (cerebral cortex, lung, liver, skeletal muscle) of 16 mice, covering postnatal development (2 days - 61 days) and ageing (93 days - 904 days) periods."

JSRV infects respiratory epithelial cells and initiates tumor growth. OPA is an important economic and welfare issue for sheep farmers but is also considered to be a valuable animal model for human lung adenocarcinoma. In this study, we investigated the pathogenesis of OPA at the gene expression level and used the deregulated gene list to tp compare to transcriptional changes occurring in human lung cancer.  Whole transcriptome profiling was performed on lung samples derived from JSRV-infected and uninfected lambs using RNA-seq. Following mapping of sequence reads to the sheep genome, differentially expressed genes were identified.  A list of 1,971 differentially expressed transcripts was identified between the two groups.  The main differentially expressed pathways of the upregulated genes were related to immune response to wound healing, tumorigenesis, epithelial cell differentiation and tissue development. Several genes involved in these biological processes were confirmed with immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR.  Important novel insights include the activation of Hippo signaling in OPA and the upregulation of a family of tyrosine kinase receptor ligands, both of which may have important contributions to oncogenesis in this disease.  In addition, a variety of myeloid cell markers were upregulated, reflecting a role for tumor associated macrophgaes in this disease. Pathway and functional annotation analysis was performed using Ingenuity pathway analysis and DAVID annotation software and sheep data were compared with already published data derived from non-small cell lung cancer cases in humans.  Many of the upregulated gene have also been shown to play an important role in human lung adenocarcinoma and ??? analysis confirmed the closer similarity of experimental OPA with early stage human lung adenocarcinoma.  Sheep lung adenocarcinoma shares important similarities with human lung adenocarcinoma.  This analysis provides a great deal of new information regarding the pathogenesis of OPA at a transcriptional level and strengthens the use of this naturally occurring animal model for human lung adenocarcinoma."

Junctional epidermolysis bullosa is a recessive genodermatosis that manifests with neonatal mechanical fragility of the skin, blistering confined to the lamina lucida of the basement membrane and severe alteration of the hemidesmosomal junctions. In Spanish Churra sheep, junctional epidermolysis bullosa with aplasia cutis congenita (JEB-ACC) has been detected in two commercial flocks. The JEB-ACC locus was mapped to Ovis aries chromosome 11 by GWAS and subsequently fine-mapped to an 868-kb homozygous segment using the identical-by-descent method. The ITGB4, which is located within this region, was identified as the best positional and functional candidate gene. The RNA-seq variant analysis enabled us to discover a 4-bp deletion within exon 33 of the ITGB4 gene (c.4412_4415del). The c.4412_4415del mutation causes a frameshift resulting in a premature stop codon at position 1472 of the integrin ?4 protein. A functional analysis of this deletion revealed decreased levels of mRNA in JEB-ACC skin samples and the absence of integrin ?4 labeling in immunohistochemical assays. Genotyping of c.4412_4415del showed perfect concordance with the recessive mode of the disease phenotype. Selection against this causal mutation will now be used to solve the problem of JEB-ACC in flocks of Churra sheep. Furthermore, the identification of the ITGB4 mutation means that affected sheep can be used as a large mammal animal model for the human form of epidermolysis bullosa with aplasia cutis. Our approach evidences that RNA-seq offers cost-effective alternative to identify variants in the species in which high resolution exome-sequencing is not straightforward."

After a first experimental infection based on the accumulative faecal egg counts, six ewes were classified as 'Susceptible' and six ewes as 'Resistant'. After second experimental infection, these animals were sacrificed and abomasal lymph node tissue samples were collected. The total polyA RNA extracted from these samples was sequenced using an Illumina Hi-SEq 2000 sequencer by generating 'paired-end' reads of 75 bp, with a depth of 30M reads per sample. Using standard pipeline with different bioinformatics tools, initially the quality of raw sequence data was assessed, followed by trimming adapter and low-quality sequences, aligning and sorting the obtained reads against the sheep reference genome (Oar_v.3.1) ensembl release 95. Then we detected potential transcripts by reference-guided transcript assembly, merging and transcript annotation and finally counted the number of transcripts in each sample in the annotated feature file. On average, the data contained 44,203 genes with 77,039 transcripts. This annotated feature file was used to detect the lncRNA with the FEELnc package. In total 9,105 lncRNA were detected.

We aimed to identify the expressed genome from the fetal sheep heart in order to identify genes and gene variants relevant to developmental studies and to provide a genomic resource for development of sheep-specific genetic tools. We used high throughput sequencing technologies to achieve these goals.    Results: Using the bovine genome as a reference for assembly and annotation of 75-bp paired-end reads, we identified 13,444 sheep fetal heart genes of which 13,064 are novel in the sheep. In addition, we identified 8,617 high confidence SNPs and 240 genes with exon splicing that differed between the cow and the sheep fetal heart transcriptome. The genes with the highest expression levels and genes with novel exons with the highest expression levels in the fetal heart transcriptome are known to play central roles in muscle development and function.     Conclusions: In this study we show that high throughput sequencing methods can generate extensive transcriptome information in the absence of an assembled and annotated genome for that species. The gene sequence data obtained provides a resource for development of genetic tools and combined with the polymorphism data will enable annotation and assembly of the sheep genome.

We classified 80 cells comprising the distal lung epithelium at E18.5 into distinct populations using an unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori knowledge of the underlying cell types or prior purification of cell types. This 'reverse tissue engineering' approach confirmed the basic outlines of the conventional model of cell type diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of a large number of novel transcriptional regulators and cell type markers that discriminate between the different populations. Moreover, we reconstructed the steps during maturation of bipotential progenitors into both alveolar lineages based on the presence of undifferentiated, differentiated as well as differentiation intermediate cells at the single time point E18.5. Finally, we followed Sftpc-positive cells throughout their lifecycle (E14.5, E16.5, E18.5, adult) and identified 7 gene sets that differentiate between the multipotential, bipotential, mature, as well as intermediate states of the AT2 lineage.

"SRP145002"	"Repurposing of promoters and enhancers during mammalian evolution"	"The spatiotemporal control of gene expression exerted by promoters and enhancers is central for organismal development, physiology and behaviour. These two types of regulatory elements have long been distinguished from each other based on their function, but recent work highlighted common architectural and functional features. It also suggested that inheritable alterations in the epigenetic and sequence context of regulatory elements might underlie evolutionary changes of their principal activity, which could result in changes in the transcriptional profile of genes under their control or even facilitate the birth of new genes. Here, based on integrated cross-mammalian analyses of DNase hypersensitivity, chromatin modification and transcriptional data, we provide support for this hypothesis by detecting 445 regulatory elements with signatures of activity turnover in sister species from the primate and rodent lineages (termed ""P/E"" elements). Through the comparison with outgroup species, we defined the directionality of turnover events, which revealed that most instances represent transformations of putative ancestral enhancers into promoters, leading to the emergence of species-specific transcribed loci or 5' exons. Notably, P/E elements have distinct GC sequence compositions and stabilizing 5' splicing (U1) regulatory motif patterns, which may predispose them to functional repurposing during evolution. Moreover, we trace changes in the U1 and polyadenylation signal densities and distributions that accompanied and likely drove the evolutionary activity switches. Overall, our work highlights functional repurposing as a notable mechanism that likely facilitated regulatory innovation and the origination of new genes and exons during mammalian evolution.

Here we describe small RNA profiling of the adult testes of Callithrix jacchus, the common marmoset. The most abundant class of small RNAs in the adult testis was piRNAs, while 353 novel miRNAs but few endo-siRNAs were also identified. MARWI, a marmoset homolog of mouse MIWI and a very abundant PIWI in adult testes, associates with piRNAs that show characteristics of mouse pachytene piRNAs. As in other mammals, most marmoset piRNAs are derived from conserved clustered regions in the genome, which are annotated as intergenic regions. However, some of these piRNA cluster regions contain antisense-orientated pseudogenes, suggesting regulation of parental functional protein-coding genes. More piRNAs map to transposable element (TE) subfamilies when they have copies in piRNA clusters. In addition, the strand-bias observed for piRNAs mapped to each TE subfamily correlates with the polarity of copies inserted in clusters. These findings suggest that pachytene piRNA clusters determine the abundance and strand-bias of TE-derived piRNAs, and also regulate protein-coding genes via pseudogene-derived piRNAs.

To identify regulators and morphogens active in mesenchyme, we performed transcriptomic analysis using Tag-seq, RNA-seq, and single cell RNA-seq and defined new mesenchymal subsets and markers. We documented transcript expression using Tag-seq and RNA-seq in female rat Ventral Mesenchymal Pad (VMP) as well as adjacent urethra comprised of smooth muscle and peri-urethral mesenchyme. Transcripts enriched in VMP were identified in Tag-seq data from microdissected tissue, and RNA-seq data derived from cell populations and single cells. We identified 400 transcripts as enriched or specific to the VMP using bio-informatic comparisons of Tag-seq and RNA-seq data. Comparison with single cell RNA-seq identified transcripts yielded 45 transcriptscommon to both approaches. Cell subset analysis showed that VMP and adjacent mesenchyme were composed of distinct cell types and that each tissue was comprised of two subgroups. Markers for these subgroups were highly subset specific. Thirteen transcripts were validated by qPCR to confirm cell specific expression in microdissected tissues, as well as expression in neonatal prostate. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that Ebf3 and Meis2 showed a restricted expression pattern in VMP condensed mesenchyme. Taken together, we demonstrate that the VMP shows limited cellular heterogeneity and that our high-resolution transcriptomic analysis identified new mesenchymal subset markers associated with prostate organogenesis.

While several pathogenic mutations have been identified, the vast majority of ALS cases have no family history of disease. Thus, for most ALS cases, the disease may be a product of multiple pathways contributing to varying degrees in each patient. Using machine learning algorithms, we stratified the transcriptomes of 148 ALS postmortem cortex samples into three distinct molecular subtypes. The largest cluster, identified in 61% of patient samples, displayed hallmarks of oxidative and proteotoxic stress. Another 19% of the samples showed predominant signatures of glial activation. Finally, a third group (20%) exhibited high levels of retrotransposon expression and signatures of TARDBP/TDP-43 dysfunction. We further demonstrated that TDP-43 (1) directly binds a subset of retrotransposon transcripts and contributes to their silencing in vitro, and (2) pathological TDP-43 aggregation correlates with retrotransposon de-silencing in vivo.

"SRP216705"	"Hemispheric asymmetry in the human brain and in Parkinson's disease is linked to divergent epigenetic patterns in neurons [RNA-seq]"	"Background Hemispheric asymmetry in neuronal processes is a fundamental feature of the human brain and drives symptom lateralization in Parkinson's disease (PD), but its molecular determinants are unknown. Here, we identify divergent epigenetic patterns involved in hemispheric asymmetry by profiling DNA methylation in isolated prefrontal cortex neurons from control and PD brain hemispheres. DNA methylation is fine-mapped at enhancers and promoters, genome-wide, by targeted bisulfite sequencing in two independent sample cohorts. Results We find that neurons of the human prefrontal cortex exhibit hemispheric differences in DNA methylation. Hemispheric asymmetry in neuronal DNA methylation patterns is largely mediated by differential CpH methylation, and chromatin conformation analysis finds that it targets thousands of genes. With aging, there is a loss of hemispheric asymmetry in neuronal epigenomes, such that hemispheres epigenetically converge in late life. In neurons of PD patients, hemispheric asymmetry in DNA methylation is greater than in controls and involves many PD risk genes. Epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic differences between PD hemispheres correspond to the lateralization of PD symptoms, with abnormalities being most prevalent in the hemisphere matched to side of symptom predominance. Hemispheric asymmetry and symptom lateralization in PD is linked to genes affecting neurodevelopment, immune activation, and synaptic transmission. PD patients with a long disease course have greater hemispheric asymmetry in neuronal epigenomes than those with a short disease course. Conclusions Hemispheric differences in epigenetic gene regulation are prevalent in neurons and may affect the progression and symptoms of PD. Overall design: In order to determine whether epigenetic divergence across hemispheres is relevant to hemispheric asymmetry in transcriptional patterns, we used RNA-sequencing to perform a transcriptional analysis in the prefrontal cortex of hemisphere of PD with known side of symptom predominance (n=36 individuals: 13 matched PD hemisphere, 11 unmatched PD hemisphere and controls n=12)"	"SRA"	"partial"									"GSE135036,PRJNA557205,PMID: 32151270 (partial because non-healthy samples)"

PD has both genetic and environmental risk factors, and while processes leading to aberrant protein aggregation are unknown, past work points to abnormal levels of SNCA and other proteins. Although several genome-wide studies have been performed for PD, these have focused on DNA sequence variants by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and on RNA levels (microarray transcriptomics), while genome-wide proteomics analysis has been lacking. After appropriate filters, proteomics identified 3,558 unique proteins and 283 of these (7.9%) were significantly different between PD and controls (q-value<0.05). RNA-sequencing identified 17,580 protein-coding genes and 1,095 of these (6.2%) were significantly different (FDR p-value<0.05), but only 166 of the FDR significant protein-coding genes (0.94%) were present among the 3,558 proteins characterized. Of these 166, eight genes (4.8%) were significant in both studies, with the same direction of effect. Functional enrichment analysis of the proteomics results strongly supports mitochondrial-related pathways, while comparable analysis of the RNA-sequencing results implicates protein folding pathways and metallothioneins. Ten of the implicated genes or proteins co-localized to GWAS loci. Evidence implicating SNCA was stronger in proteomics than in RNA-sequencing analyses. Notably, differentially expressed protein-coding genes were more likely to not be characterized in the proteomics analysis, which lessens the ability to compare across platforms. Combining multiple genome-wide platforms offers novel insights into the pathological processes responsible for this disease by identifying pathways implicated across methodologies. Overall design: The study consists of mRNA-Seq (29 PD, 44 neurologically normal controls) and three-stage Mass Spectrometry Tandem Mass Tag Proteomics (12 PD, 12 neurologically normal controls) performed in post-mortem BA9 brain tissue.

Previous studies in model organisms revealed the importance of nutrient sensing, mTOR, NAD/sirtuins and insulin/IGF1 signaling in lifespan control. By studying life history traits and transcriptomes of 14 Drosophila species differing more than 6-fold in lifespan, we explored expression divergence and identified genes and processes that correlate with longevity. These longevity signatures suggested that longer-lived flies up-regulate fatty acid metabolism, down-regulate neuronal system development and activin signaling, and alter dynamics of RNA splicing. Interestingly, these gene expression patterns resembled those of flies under dietary restriction and several other lifespan-extending interventions, although on the individual gene level, there was no significant overlap with genes previously reported to have lifespan extension effects. We experimentally tested the lifespan regulation potential of several candidate genes and found no consistent effects, suggesting that individual genes generally do not explain the observed longevity patterns. Instead, it appears that lifespan regulation across species is modulated by complex relationships at the system level represented by global gene expression."

However, the extent of fibroblast heterogeneity in human skin is unknown. Here, using a combination of spatial transcriptional profiling of human and mouse dermis and single cell transcriptional profiling of human dermal fibroblasts, we show that there are at least four distinct fibroblast populations in adult human skin. We define markers permitting prospective isolation of these cells and show that although marker expression is rapidly lost in culture, different fibroblast subpopulations retain distinct functionality in terms of Wnt signalling, T cell communication and the ability to support human epidermal reconstitution in organotypic culture. Furthermore, while some fibroblast subpopulations are spatially segregated, others are not. These findings have profound implications for normal wound healing and diseases characterized by excessive fibrosis, and suggest that ex vivo expansion or in vivo ablation of specific fibroblast subpopulations may have therapeutic applications.

In each of the tissues assessed, we identified between 128 and 805 genes with conserved sex-biased expression. However, most sex bias in gene expression (~77%) - both female and male - has arisen since the last common ancestor of boroeutherian mammals, likely facilitated by reduced selective constraint. Evolutionary gains and losses of regulation by sex-biased transcription factors drove a significant fraction (~27%) of lineage-specific changes in sex bias. Our study suggests caution in the use of other species as models of human sex differences, and that similar selective pressures have driven sex-biased gene expression both within and outside the reproductive tract.

Using RNA sequencing, we have generated extensive and comparable miRNA data for five organs in six species that represent all main mammalian lineages and birds (the evolutionary outgroup), with the aim to unravel the evolution of mammalian miRNAs. Our analyses reveal an overall expansion of miRNA repertoires in mammals, with three-fold accelerated birth rates of miRNA families in placentals and marsupials, facilitated by the de novo emergence of miRNAs in host gene introns. Generally, our analyses suggest a high rate of miRNA family turnover in mammals, with many newly emerged miRNA families being lost soon after their formation. Selectively preserved mammalian miRNA families gradually evolved higher expression levels as well as altered mature sequences and target gene repertoires, and were apparently mainly recruited to exert regulatory functions in nervous tissues. However, miRNAs that originated on the X chromosome evolved high expression levels and potentially diverse functions during spermatogenesis, including meiosis, through selectively driven duplication-divergence processes. Overall, our study thus provides detailed insights into the birth and evolution of mammalian miRNA genes and the associated selective forces. Overall design: 30 main samples from five adult tissues (brain, cerebellum, heart, kidney and testis) collected in six species (human, macaque, mouse, opossum, platypus and chicken) + 5 biological replicates + 3 samples from spermatogenic cells in adult mouse testis (Sertoli cells, spermatocytes and spermatids)"	"SRA"	"total"		38			"GSE40499"	"PRJNA174234"	"PMID: 23034410"	"http://genome.cshlp.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=23034410"

Bioinformatics analysis revealed several candidate genes potentially involved in spermatogenesis, spermiogenesis and flagella formation in testis and post-testicular sperm maturation in epididymis and ductus deferens. The achievement of spermatozoa motility during post-testicular maturation were found to be linked with development of flagellum actin filaments and biochemical processes including Ca2+ influx and protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Finally, genes involved in reproductive system development and morphogenesis were identified.

"SRP279079"	"Multitissue transcriptomic profiling during onset of salmon maturation"	"We sequenced mRNA from four biological replicates of each tissue before (T1) and after the onset of maturation (T2, T3, T4). A total of 3.2 billion paired-end reads were mapped against the Atlantic salmon reference genome with 72% mapping efficiency to create an average depth of 50 million reads per library. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased with elapsed time following the onset of the long light photoperiod for the two BPG axis tissues (pituitary and ovary). Of these, the ovary underwent the most dramatic remodelling over time with 403, 1,709 and then 3,497 DEGs observed at timepoints T2, T3 and T4 respectively. This increasing trajectory of differential ngene expression, coupled with the elevated GSI following the light stimuli, strongly suggests the experimental approach successfully initiated the onset of maturation. Next, we identified clusters of DEGs in each of the analysed tissues, which describe their physiological roles. The identity of the DEGs, in response to the onset of maturation, revealed the key players involved in the earliest triggers into maturation. Among these, upregulation of genes encoding specififc pituitary hormones such as gonadotropins along with genes encoding transcription factors (such as GATA2) are significant in controlling onset of maturation. In addition, genes encoding pituitary hormone receptors and follicular development were upregulated in ovary. Overall design: We sequenced mRNA from four biological replicates of four tissues (brain, pituitary gland, ovary and liver) at four timepoints before (T1) and after the onset of maturation (T2, T3, T4)."

Cyberlindnera jadinii (CJ) and Wickerhamomyces anomalus (WA) yeasts were produced in-house and processed by direct heat-inactivation with spray-drying (ICJ and IWA) or autolyzed at 50 ºC for 16 h (ACJ and AWA), followed by spray-drying. Six diets were formulated, one based on fishmeal (FM), a challenging diet with 30% soybean meal (SBM) and four other diets containing 30% SBM and 10% of each of the four yeast fractions (i.e., ICJ, ACJ, IWA and AWA). The results showed that the inclusion of CJ yeasts reduced loss of supranuclear vacuolization, along with reduction in population of CD8α positive cells present in the lamina propria of fish fed the SBM diet. The CJ yeasts controlled the inflammatory profile of fish fed SBM through up-regulation of pathways related to wound healing and taurine metabolism. Additionally, the WA yeasts dampened the inflammatory profile of fish fed SBM through down-regulation of pathways related to toll-like receptor signaling, C-lectin receptor, cytokine receptor and signal transduction. The results suggest that yeasts could be used as protein ingredients with functional properties in diets for Atlantic salmon.
