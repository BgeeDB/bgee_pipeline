The  isolated embryos were further selected and assigned to appropriate samples based on cell numbers (up   to   16-cell   stage)   or   morphology   (blastocysts)...To isolate individual cells from embryos, we first removed the zona pellucida using acid  Tyrode’s  solution  (Sigma),  and  washed  embryos  twice  with  M 2  medium  (Sigma). We  then  used  TrypLE  (Invitrogen)  to  dissociate  embryos  into  single  cells. Incubation time  varied  from  30  seconds  to  5  minutes  depending  on  the  embryonic  stage.  For dissociation  of  blastocyst  embryos,  we  applied  an  additional  mechanical  di ssociation  by mouth pipetting, with a finely pulled glass capillary following TrypLE digestion. Single cells  were  washed  with  DMEM/F12  medium  (Invitrogen)  before  manually  picked  into hypotonic  Smart-seq  lysis  buffer.  We  either  directly  prepared  Smart-seq  cDNA  libraries or snap-froze samples on dry ice and kept at -80°C for future preparation.
