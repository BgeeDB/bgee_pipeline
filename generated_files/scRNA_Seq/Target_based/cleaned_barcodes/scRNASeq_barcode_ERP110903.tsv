Two of which (early photoreceptor (EPR) and late photoreceptor (LPR)) were identified as photoreceptors based on the presence of the classical neuronal markers elav, futsch and Appl (Fig. 3a). The remaining two are interommatidial cells (INT and SMW) since they expressed posterior markers such as ed (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Data 1) and Mmp2 (Fig. 3a) but lacked the expression of neuronal genes."	7
