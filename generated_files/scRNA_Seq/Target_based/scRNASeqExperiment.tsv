The epithelium may contribute to these functions directly, or via crosstalk with immune cells. We resolved the spatio-temporal immune topology of the human kidney with a scRNAseq dataset from 40,268 mature and 27,203 fetal kidney cells. Within the epithelial compartment there were zonated patterns of immune gene expression, with pelvic epithelial anti-microbial peptide expression in mature but not fetal kidneys. Tissue-resident immune cells were evident in both fetal and mature kidney, with post-natal acquisition of infection-defense capabilities.

SRP329970	A human breast transcriptome atlas	The breast is a dynamic organ whose response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions alters its disease susceptibility, yet the specific effects of these clinical variables on cell state remain poorly annotated. We present a unified, high-resolution breast atlas by integrating single-cell RNA-seq, mass cytometry, and cyclic immunofluorescence, encompassing a myriad of states. We define cell subtypes within the alveolar, hormone-sensing, and basal epithelial lineages, delineating associations of several subtypes with cancer risk factors, including age, parity, and BRCA2 germline mutation. Of particular interest is a subset of alveolar cells termed basal-luminal (BL) cells, which exhibit poor transcriptional lineage fidelity, accumulate with age, and carry a gene signature associated with basal-like breast cancer. We further utilize a medium-depletion approach to identify molecular factors regulating cell-subtype proportion in organoids. Together, these data are a rich resource to elucidate diverse mammary cell states. Overall design: A total of 16 breast samples were assayed (4 samples from reductive mammoplasties and 12 from prophylactic mastectomies).

SRP251970	A single-cell survey of Drosophila blood	Drosophila blood cells, called the hemocytes, are composed of three distinct cell populations: plasmatocytes (PM), crystal cells (CC), and lamellocytes (LM). These cell types have been extensively characterized based on the expression of a few marker genes and cell morphologies, which are inadequate to classify the complete hemocyte repertoire. Further, intermediate states along the course of maturation of these cell types have been poorly characterized. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map the Drosophila larval hemocytes across different inflammatory conditions. We identified all known cell types, resolved PMs into different states based on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, antimicrobial response, and metabolism together with the detection of CC and LM intermediates. Further, we discovered rare cells within CC and LM populations that express the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligand branchless (bnl) and receptor breathless (btl), respectively. We demonstrate that both bnl and btl are required for mediating effective immune responses against parasitoid wasp eggs in vivo, highlighting a novel role for FGF signaling in inter-hemocyte crosstalk. Our scRNA-seq analysis reveals the diversity of hemocyte populations and provides a rich resource of gene expression profiles for a systems-level understanding of their functions.

SRP162698	A cell atlas of the adult Drosophila midgut	Drosophila guts were dissociated to single cells as previously described (Dutta et al., 2015) with a few modifications. Guts were dissected from 7-day old adult esg-sfGFP/+, pros- Gal4>RFP/+ females. After pulling out the gut, the crop and midgut/hindgut junction (where the Malpighian tubules branch out of the gut) and Malpighian tubules were removed. Five flies at a time were dissected and immediately transferred into cold PBS containing 1% BSA to avoid exposing the midgut tissue to room temperature for a long period of time. Once 40 guts were dissected, they were transferred to a dissection plate and chopped into small pieces using a razor blade. These small fragments were immediately transferred to an eppendorf tube containing 400 ul of 1 mg/ml elastase/PBS solution (Sigma E0258) and incubated on a shaker at 27 ÌC for 30 min. 1% of BSA in PBS (final concentration) was used to stop the digestion reaction and prevent cells from aggregating. The cell suspension was passed through 100 um and then a 40 um cell strainer and loaded on the top of Optiprep with density gradient 1.12 g/ml. Viable cells were isolated from the top layer of the sample after centrifugation at 800xg for 20 min. Cell viability and number were assessed by 0.4% trypan blue and hemocytometer.

SRP200614	Single-cell sequencing of enteroendocrine cells (EEs) in Drosophila midgut.	Enteroendocrine cells (EEs) in the intestinal epithelium have important endocrine functions, yet this cell lineage exhibits great local and regional variations that have hampered detailed characterization of EE subtypes. Through single cell RNA-sequencing analysis, combined with a collection of neuropeptide/receptor knock-in strains, here we provide a comprehensive analysis of cellular diversity, spatial distribution and transcription factor (TF) code of EEs in adult Drosophila midgut. We identify 10 major EE subtypes that totally produced 14 different classes of hormone peptides. Each EE on average co-produces 2-5 different classes of hormone peptides. Functional screen with subtype-enriched TFs suggests a combinatorial TF code that controls EE cell diversity, with class-specific TFs Mirr and Ptx1that respectively define two major classes of EEs, and regional TFs such as Esg, Drm, Exex and Fer1that further define regional EE identity. Our single-cell data should greatly facilitate Drosophila modeling of EE differentiation and function. Overall design: FACS sort EE cells using CG32547-KI-GAL4> uas-GFP line and perform 10X genomics single cell sequencing. Raw data was further processed by Seurat algorithm and EE subtypes were visualized by generating a t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) plot.

ERP129698	The Fly Cell Atlas: single-cell transcriptomes of the entire adult Drosophila - 10x dataset	Single-cell technologies have ushered in a new era for Drosophila research, allowing researchers to obtain transcriptomes for all stable cell types and dynamic cell states. Here we present the first release of the adult Fly Cell Atlas (FCA), which includes 580k cells from 15 individually dissected sexed tissues, as well as from the entire head and body. We annotated more than 250 distinct cell types across all tissues. Few cell types were uniquely detected in the entire head and body samples, suggesting high cell-type saturation. We provide an in-depth analysis of gene signatures and transcription factor combinations, as well as sexual dimorphism, across the whole animal. Finally, we studied cell type lineages that are shared between tissues, such as blood cells and muscle cells, allowing the retrieval of rare cell types and tissue- specific subtypes. This atlas provides a valuable resource for the entire Drosophila community as a reference to study genetic perturbations and disease models at single-cell resolution.

SRP184201	Modular transcriptional programs separately define axon and dendrite connectivity	Patterns of synaptic connectivity are remarkably precise and complex. Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed a vast transcriptional diversity of neurons. Nevertheless, a clear logic underlying the transcriptional control of neuronal connectivity has yet to emerge. Here, we focused on Drosophila T4/T5 neurons, a class of closely related neuronal subtypes with different wiring patterns. Eight subtypes of T4/T5 neurons are defined by combinations of two patterns of dendritic inputs and four patterns of axonal outputs. Single-cell profiling during development revealed distinct transcriptional programs defining each dendrite and axon wiring pattern. These programs were defined by the expression of a few transcription factors and different combinations of cell surface proteins. Gain and loss of function studies provide evidence for independent control of different wiring features. We propose that modular transcriptional programs for distinct wiring features are assembled in different combinations to generate diverse patterns of neuronal connectivity. Overall design: Single-cell profiling of FACS purified populations of Drosophila melanogaster T4/T5 neurons during pupal development (24h and 48h APF).

SRP269263	Single-cell transcriptomics uncovers human corneal limbal stem cells and its differentiation trajectory	Limbal stem cells (LSCs), known as corneal epithelial stem cells, are located at the basal epithelial layer of the corneal limbus and serve an important function in maintaining the homeostasis of the corneal epithelium. Several putative molecular markers of LSCs have been previously identified. However, the specificity of these markers remains largely controversial. To address this gap in the current understanding of LSCs, we performed a transcriptome profiling of heterogeneous corneal limbal basal cells using single-cell transcriptomics technology to identify LSCs and their exclusive markers. We isolated limbal basal cells from two young donors, constructed scRNA-seq libraries, generated RNA-sequencing data using the 10x Genomics platform, and then finally obtained the transcriptome of about 18,000 individual single-cells using Cell ranger (https://10xgenomics.com). Next, we performed quality control, filtering and data integration using Seurat package (https://satijalab.org/seurat), about 16,400 cells were retained for further downstream analysis such as dimensional reduction, unsupervised clustering, and Differentially expressed gene selection, trajectory analysis and visualization. We identified 11 unique clusters of cells assigned to a putative cell type based on published known biomarkers for differentiation, proliferation and putative epithelial stem cells. As a results, we found 2 Terminally Differentiated Cell (TDC), 3 Post-Mitotic Cell (PMC), 1 Transient Amplifying Cell (TAC), 2 Limbal Progenitor Cell (LPC), Putative Limbal Stem Cell (LSC) and 2 Melanocyte (MC) sub-cell type clusters. Furthermore, we confirmed the trajectory order of LSC differentiation for 9 clusters using Pseudotemporal and Functional PCA analysis. Lastly, we validated each assigned cell subtypes and determined their location in human corneal limbus tissue with 9 markers using RNAscope We were able to reveal the heterogeneity of corneal limbal basal epithelium by defining novel dynamic trajectories for cell types in a pseudotemporal manner. This approach allowed us to identify the distinct clusters of LSCs and progenitors with exclusively expressed markers, and might apply for translational research on regenerating a normal corneal epithelium and restoring vision. Overall design: We isolated limbal basal cells from two young donors, constructed scRNA-seq libraries, generated RNA-sequencing data using the 10x Genomics platform, and then finally obtained the transcriptome of about 18,000 individual single-cells using Cell ranger (https://10xgenomics.com). Next, we performed quality control, filtering and data integration and further downstream analysis such as dimensional reduction, unsupervised clustering, and Differentially expressed gene selection, trajectory analysis and visualization.

SRP337049	scRNA sequencing analysis for human ureters and patient derived ureter oragnoid	Tissue engineering offers a promising treatment strategy for ureteral strictures. Successful ureter engineering is necessitated by detailed understanding of the tissue architecture, cellular heterogeneity, and signaling pathways underlying regeneration. We define and spatially map cell populations within the human ureter by using a combinatorial approach: single-cell RNA sequencing, 10X Visium spatial transciptomics, and immunofluorescence. The stromal and urothelial cell populations are analyzed in detail, and we infer potential cell-cell communication networks underpinning the bi-directional crosstalk between these compartments. Specifically, we analyze and experimentally validate the importance of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway in adult stem cell maintenance. The SHH-expressing basal cells support organoid generation in vitro, and accurately predict the differentiation trajectory of basal stem cells, to terminally differentiated umbrella cells, in vivo. Our results highlight essential processes involved in adult ureter tissue homeostasis, and provide a toolkit for guiding ureter tissue engineering. Overall design: 10 normal human ureters each were subjected to RNA sequencing at single cell resolution on Novaseq using 10X Gemonics library preparation platform. Data was processed using Cellranger 4.0.0 and anayzed using Seurat v3.2.1 to characterize various cell types and understand finer details of the regenrative pathways in the ureter urothelium. This was further explored by analyzing single cell RNA sequencing data from human ureter derived organoid (generated in the same manner as the 10 ureter samples). Freshly processed and thawed tissue sample from the same human subject was used as control to further understand the urothelial regenerative pathways.

ERP136992	A spatial multi-omics atlas of the human lung reveals a novel immune cell survival niche	Multiple distinct cell types of the human lung and airways have been defined by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). Here we present a multi-omics spatial lung atlas to define novel cell types which we map back into the macro- and micro-anatomical tissue context to define functional tissue microenvironments. Firstly, we have generated single cell and nuclei RNA sequencing, VDJ-sequencing and Visium Spatial Transcriptomics data sets from 5 different locations of the human lung and airways. Secondly, we define additional cell types/states, as well as spatially map novel and known human airway cell types, such as adult lung chondrocytes, submucosal gland (SMG) duct cells, distinct pericyte and smooth muscle subtypes, immune-recruiting fibroblasts, peribronchial and perichondrial fibroblasts, peripheral nerve associated fibroblasts and Schwann cells. Finally, we define a survival niche for IgA-secreting plasma cells at the SMG, comprising the newly defined epithelial SMG-Duct cells, and B and T lineage immune cells. Using our transcriptomic data for cell-cell interaction analysis, we propose a signalling circuit that establishes and supports this niche. Overall, we provide a transcriptional and spatial lung atlas with multiple novel cell types that allows for the study of specific tissue microenvironments such as the newly defined gland-associated lymphoid niche (GALN).
