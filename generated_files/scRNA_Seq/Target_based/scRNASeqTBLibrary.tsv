Whole organs were then dissected in the following order: large intestine, spleen, thymus, trachea, tongue, brain, heart, lung, kidney, gonadal adipose tissue (GAT), bladder, diaphragm, limb muscle (tibialis anterior), skin (dorsal), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT, inguinal pad), mammary glands (fat pads 2, 3, and 4), brown adipose tissue (BAT, interscapular pad), aorta, and bone marrow (spine and limb bones). Following single cell dissociation as described below, cell suspensions were either used for FACS of individual cells into 384-well plates, or for microfluidic droplet library preparation./https://figshare.com/articles/Single-cell_RNA-seq_data_from_microfluidic_emulsion/5715025 for sex information	ANN	2019-11-26	NA	NA	SRS3044238	scRNA-seq	10X Genomics	3'end	v2
