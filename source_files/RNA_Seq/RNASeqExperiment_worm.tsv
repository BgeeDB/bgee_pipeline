Dietary restriction (DR) extends lifespan and promotes metabolic health in evolutionary distinct species. The RNA-seq data comprises 4 age groups (1, 5, 10 and 20 days after L4) and 2 different conditions (rotenone and normal feeding (DMSO)) Overall design: 22 samples: mRNA profiles of 1-day, 5-day and 10-day old worms as triplicates for each, rotenone and solvent control treatment; mRNA profiles of 20-day old worms as duplicates for each, rotenone and solvent control treatment"	"GEO"	"partial"	"GSE46051"
