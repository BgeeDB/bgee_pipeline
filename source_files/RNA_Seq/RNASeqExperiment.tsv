"GSE30352"	"The evolution of gene expression levels in mammalian organs"	"Changes in gene expression are thought to underlie many of the phenotypic differences between species. However, large-scale analyses of gene expression evolution were until recently prevented by technological limitations. Here we report the sequencing of polyadenylated RNA from six organs across ten species that represent all major mammalian lineages (placentals, marsupials and monotremes) and birds (the evolutionary outgroup), with the goal of understanding the dynamics of mammalian transcriptome evolution. We show that the rate of gene expression evolution varies among organs, lineages and chromosomes, owing to differences in selective pressures: transcriptome change was slow in nervous tissues and rapid in testes, slower in rodents than in apes and monotremes, and rapid for the X chromosome right after its formation. Although gene expression evolution in mammals was strongly shaped by purifying selection, we identify numerous potentially selectively driven expression switches, which occurred at different rates across lineages and tissues and which probably contributed to the specific organ biology of various mammals. Our transcriptome data provide a valuable resource for functional and evolutionary analyses of mammalian genomes."	"GEO"	"total"

"GSE41338"	"The evolutionary landscape of alternative splicing in vertebrate species"	"How species with similar repertoires of protein coding genes differ so dramatically at the phenotypic level is poorly understood. From comparing the transcriptomes of multiple organs from vertebrate species spanning ~350 million years of evolution, we observe significant differences in alternative splicing complexity between the main vertebrate lineages, with the highest complexity in the primate lineage. Moreover, within as little as six million years, the splicing profiles of physiologically-equivalent organs have diverged to the extent that they are more strongly related to the identity of a species than they are to organ type. Most vertebrate species-specific splicing patterns are governed by the highly variable use of a largely conserved cis-regulatory code. However, a smaller number of pronounced species-dependent splicing changes are predicted to remodel interactions involving factors acting at multiple steps in gene regulation. These events are expected to further contribute to the dramatic diversification of alternative splicing as well as to other gene regulatory changes that contribute to phenotypic differences among vertebrate species."

"GSE41637"	"Evolutionary dynamics of gene and isoform regulation in mammalian tissues"	"Most mammalian genes produce multiple distinct mRNAs through alternative splicing, but the extent of splicing conservation is not clear. To assess tissue-specific transcriptome variation across mammals, we sequenced cDNA from 9 tissues from 4 mammals and one bird in biological triplicate, at unprecedented depth. We find that while tissue-specific gene expression programs are largely conserved, alternative splicing is well conserved in only a subset of tissues and is frequently lineage-specific. Thousands of novel, lineage-specific and conserved alternative exons were identified; widely conserved alternative exons had signatures of binding by MBNL, PTB, RBFOX, STAR and TIA family splicing factors, implicating them as ancestral mammalian splicing regulators. Our data also indicates that alternative splicing is often used to alter protein phosphorylatability, delimiting the scope of kinase signaling."	"GEO"	"total"

We analyzed the poly- adenylated transcriptomes of 8 organs (cortex/whole brain without cerebellum, cerebellum, heart, kidney, liver, placenta, ovary and testis) and 11 species (human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, macaque, mouse, opossum, platypus, chicken and the frog Xenopus tropicalis), which shared a common ancestor ~370 millions of years (MY) ago. Our dataset included 47 strand-specific samples, which allowed us to confirm the orientation of gene predictions and to address the evolution of sense-antisense transcripts.

"GSE43721"	"Cellular source and mechanisms of high transcriptome complexity in the mammalian testis (RNA-Seq organs)"	"Understanding the extent of genomic transcription and its functional relevance is a central goal in genomics research. However, detailed genome-wide investigations of transcriptome complexities in major mammalian organs and their underlying cellular sources, transcriptional mechanisms, and functional relevance have been scarce. Here we first show, using extensive RNA-seq data, that transcription of both functional and nonfunctional genomic elements is substantially more widespread in the testis than in other organs across representative mammals. By scrutinizing the transcriptomes of all main testicular cell types in the mouse, we then reveal that meiotic spermatocytes and especially post-meiotic round spermatids have remarkably diverse transcriptomes, which explains the high transcriptome complexity of the testis as a whole. The widespread transcriptional activity in spermatocytes and spermatids encompasses protein-coding genes and long noncoding RNA genes but also poorly conserved intergenic sequences, suggesting that much of it is not of immediate functional relevance. Rather, our analyses of genome-wide epigenetic data show that this prevalent transcription, which apparently promoted the birth of new genes during evolution, results from a highly permissive chromatin state during and after meiosis that may ultimately facilitate the replacement of histones by protamines during late spermatogenesis."

Here, we utilized Illumina sequencing technology to determine differential expression patterns for both zebrafish IRFs and type-I IFNs during two stages of SVCV infection, i.e. 6h and 24h post-infection. For 12 zebrafish IRFs, we identified DrIRF1 mRNA as one of the most abundant in normal tissues and also in SVCV-infected tissues, but DrIRF11 had a very weak basal expression and was almost not induced by SVCV infection. We also identified the highly basal expression of DrIRF7, which together with DrIRF3, was highly induced by SVCV infection.

"GSE71681"	"Yap and Taz regulate retinal pigment epithelial cell fate"	"The optic vesicle comprises a pool of bi-potential progenitor cells from which the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and neural retina fates segregate during ocular morphogenesis. Several transcription factors and signaling pathways have been shown to be important for RPE maintenance and differentiation, but an understanding of the initial fate specification and determination of this ocular cell type is lacking. We show that Yap/Taz-Tead activity is necessary and sufficient for optic vesicle progenitors to adopt RPE identity in zebrafish. A Teadresponsive transgene is expressed within the domain of the optic cup from which RPE arises, and Yap immunoreactivity localizes to the nuclei of prospective RPE cells. yap (yap1) mutants lack a subset of RPE cells and/or exhibit coloboma. Loss of RPE in yap mutants is exacerbated in combination with taz (wwtr1) mutant alleles such that, when Yap and Taz are both absent, optic vesicle progenitor cells completely lose their ability to form RPE. The mechanism of Yap dependent RPE cell type determination is reliant on both nuclear localization of Yap and interaction with a Tead co-factor. In contrast to loss of Yap and Taz, overexpression of either protein within optic vesicle progenitors leads to ectopic pigmentation in a dosagedependent manner. Overall, this study identifies Yap and Taz as key early regulators of RPE genesis and provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the congenital ocular defects of Sveinsson's chorioretinal atrophy and congenital retinal coloboma."

Finding driver genes within large chromosomal events is especially challenging because such alterations encompass many genes. Previously, we demonstrated that zebrafish malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aneuploid, much like human tumors. In this study, we examined 147 zebrafish MPNSTs by massively parallel sequencing and identified both large and focal copy number alterations (CNAs). Given the low degree of conserved synteny between fish and mammals, we reasoned that comparative analyses of CNAs from fish versus human MPNSTs would enable elimination of a large proportion of passenger mutations, especially on large CNAs. Accordingly, we found less than one third of the human CNA genes were co-gained or co-lost in zebrafish, dramatically narrowing the list of candidate cancer drivers for both focal and large CNAs. We conclude that zebrafish-human comparative analysis represents a powerful, and broadly applicable, tool to enrich for evolutionarily conserved cancer drivers. --- This filing comprises data related to GEO entry GSE23666 (""Highly Aneuploid Zebrafish Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors have Genetic Alterations Similar to Human Cancers""), representing a followup study."

However, the cellular and molecular drivers of this evolutionary transition remain unknown for most mammal groups. Here, we identify such drivers in the living marsupial opossum Monodelphis domestica, whose MC transformation during development anatomically mirrors the evolutionary transformation observed in fossils. Specifically, we link increases in cellular apoptosis and TGF-BR2 signalling to MC breakdown in opossums. We demonstrate that a simple change in TGF-b signalling is sufficient to inhibit MC breakdown during opossum development, indicating that changes in TGF-b signalling might be key during mammalian evolution. Furthermore, the apoptosis that we observe during opossum MC breakdown does not seemingly occur in mouse, consistent with homoplastic DMME evolution in the marsupial and placental lineages."

Salmonids contribute to local and global economies through aquaculture, wild stock fisheries and recreational sport fisheries. In addition, they are a traditional food source for aboriginal peoples and play a central role in their culture. Salmon and trout are sentinel species for monitoring the aquatic environment, and therefore they are used extensively for eco-toxicology studies. Importantly, the common ancestor of salmon and trout experienced a whole genome duplication (60-100MYA), and modern species may be considered pseudo tetraploid as they are well along the process of reverting to a stable diploid state. There is a large salmonid research community working on the biology, life histories, population dynamics, biogeography, phylogenetic relationships, physiology and nutrition of salmonids. No other species group of fishes receives such comprehensive commercial and scientific attention. p An International Collaboration to Sequence the Atlantic Salmon Genome (ICSASG), representing researchers, funding agencies and industry from Canada, Chile and Norway, was formed to undertake a comprehensive genome sequence that would benefit all salmonids. p Note: Double haploid individual chosen for sequencing"	"SRA"	"partial"	"PRJNA72713"

We present an atlas of RNA abundance for 92 adult, juvenile and fetal cattle tissues and 3 cattle cell lines. Results: The Bovine Gene Atlas was generated from 7.2 million unique digital gene expression tag sequences (300.2 million total raw tag sequences), from which 1.59 million unique tag sequences were identified that mapped to the bovine genome accounting for 85% of the total raw tag abundance. Filtering these tags yielded 87,764 unique tag sequences that unambiguously mapped to 16,517 annotated protein-coding loci in the genome accounting for 45% of the total raw tag abundance. Clustering of tissues based on tag abundance profiles generally confirmed ontology classification based on anatomy. There were 5,429 constitutively expressed loci and 3,445 constitutively expressed unique tag sequences mapping outside annotated gene boundaries that represent a resource for enhancing current gene models. Physical measures such as inferred transcript length or antisense tag abundance identified tissues with atypical transcriptional tag profiles. We report for the first time the tissue specific variation in the proportion of mitochondrial transcriptional tag abundance. The Bovine Gene Atlas can be examined at http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/bovineatlas . Conclusions: The Bovine Gene Atlas is the deepest and broadest transcriptome survey of any livestock genome to date. Commonalities and variation in sense and antisense transcript tag profiles identified in different tissues facilitate the examination of the relationship between gene expression, tissue, and gene function. Overall design: An atlas of mRNA abundance for 92 adult, juvenile and fetal cattle tissues and 3 cattle cell lines."	"GEO"	"partial"	"GSE21544; discarded, DpnII tag-based libraries"

Surprisingly, over half of euchromatic TEs show spread of repressive epigenetic marks to nearby DNA, resulting in differential epigenetic states of homologous genic alleles and, in return, selection against TEs. Interestingly, compared to D. melanogaster, the lower TE content in D. simulans is correlated with stronger epigenetic effects of TEs and higher levels of host genetic factors known to promote epigenetic silencing. We conclude that the epigenetic effects of euchromatic TEs, and host genetic factors modulating such effects, play a critical role in the population dynamics of TEs within and between species.

In this study, we measured the gene-expression profile of retinas microdissected from a zebrafish pde6cw59 (pde6c) mutant. Its retinas display not only photoreceptor degeneration but also issues in other cell types starting from 4 days postfertilization (dpf). To capture these initial changes, we subjected pde6c and wild-type (WT) retinas at 5 dpf to RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The sequencing analyses indicate that the RNA-Seq dataset was of high quality. We also validated the RNA-Seq results by Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) of seven phototransduction genes. We found that the fold changes of these genes measured by RT-qPCR highly correlated to those measured by RNA-Seq.

"SRP094623"	"Anguilla anguilla Transcriptome or Gene expression"	"Understanding the mechanisms underlying morphological/phenotypic dimorphism and plasticity, including the genomic basis and links to ecological influences, remains one of the major challenges in evolutionary biology. One prime example of phenotypically plastic species distributed along various environmental gradients is the European eel, Anguilla anguilla. At the juvenile (yellow eel) stage of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla), two morphotypes are found: broad- and narrow-heads. This dimorphism has been linked to dietary differences, with broad-heads feeding on harder and larger prey than narrow-heads. However, recent research showed that both morphotypes could already be distinguished at the glass eel stage, the non-feeding predecessor of the yellow eel stage, implying that factors other than trophic segregation play a role in the development of this head shape dimorphism. Here, we used gene transcription profiling (RNAseq) to identify significantly differential expressed genes between broad- and narrow-headed glass eels. Identification of these genes would strongly increase our understanding of the mechanism behind this dimorphism and its ecological implications. We found 260 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between the morphotypes, of which most were related to defense and immune responses. Interestingly, two genes involved in growth (soma and igf2) were significantly up-regulated in narrow-heads, while also nine genes involved in chemotaxis showed a significant differential expression. As such, we found support for the observation that head shape is also associated with somatic growth, with fast-growing eels developing a narrower head. Additionally, observations in the wild have shown that slow-growers prefer freshwater, while fast-growers prefer brackish water. The differential expression of genes involved in chemotaxis indeed seems to indicate that glass eel growth rate and habitat choice are related to each other. We hence hypothesize that two levels of segregations could take place in the European eel: first according to habitat choice, secondly according to feeding preference."	"SRA"	"total"	"PRJNA355998"

We identified 10,813 lncRNAs in Sus scrofa, of which 9,075 are novel. 57% of these lncRNAs were conserved in both human and mouse. These conserved lncRNAs tend to be more tissue-specific than pig-specific lncRNAs, and enriched in reproducible organs (i.e. testis and ovary). We characterized a group of lncRNAs potentially involved in the skeletal muscle development. One such lncRNA, a homolog of maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), was specifically expressed in the skeletal muscle at early developmental stage. And its expression pattern is conserved in pig and mouse. By over-expressing and knocking down MEG3 in mouse myoblast cell lines, we demonstrated its novel function as a myoblast proliferation suppressor.

"SRP009426"	"Comprehensive identification of long non-coding RNAs expressed during zebrafish embryogenesis [RNA_seq]"	"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a diverse class of transcripts that structurally resemble mRNAs but do not encode proteins. Recent genome-wide studies in human and mouse have annotated lncRNAs expressed in cell lines and adult tissues, but a systematic analysis of lncRNAs expressed during vertebrate embryogenesis has been elusive. To identify lncRNAs with potential functions in vertebrate embryogenesis, we performed a time series of RNA-Seq experiments at eight stages during early zebrafish development. We reconstructed 56,535 high-confidence transcripts in 28,912 loci, recovering the vast majority of expressed RefSeq transcripts, while identifying thousands of novel isoforms and expressed loci. We defined a stringent set of 1,133 non-coding multi-exonic transcripts expressed during embryogenesis. These include long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs), intronic overlapping lncRNAs, exonic antisense overlapping lncRNAs, and precursors for small RNAs (sRNAs). Zebrafish lncRNAs share many of the characteristics of their mammalian counterparts: relatively short length, low exon number, low expression, and conservation levels comparable to introns. Subsets of lncRNAs carry chromatin signatures characteristic of genes with developmental functions. The temporal expression profile of lncRNAs revealed two novel properties: lncRNAs are expressed in narrower time windows than protein-coding genes and are specifically enriched in early-stage embryos. In addition, several lncRNAs show tissue-specific expression and distinct subcellular localization patterns. Integrative computational analyses associated individual lncRNAs with specific pathways and functions, ranging from cell cycle regulation to morphogenesis. Our study provides the first comprehensive identification of lncRNAs in a vertebrate embryo and forms the foundation for future genetic, genomic and evolutionary studies.

"SRP012154"	"Next generation sequencing reveals differentially expressed genes associated with development of PSE turkey meat."	"The success of turkey breeding for rapid growth rate and larger breast size has coincided with an increasing incidence of a meat quality defect described as pale, soft and exudative (PSE). We hypothesized that this defect, which is associated with an abnormally rapid rate of postmortem metabolism, derives from altered expression of genes involved in metabolic regulation. Our objective was to use deep transcriptome RNA sequence analysis (RNAseq) to identify differentially expressed genes between normal and PSE turkey breasts. Following harvest of turkey breasts (n = 43), the pH at 15 min post-slaughter and percent marinade uptake at 24h post-slaughter were determined. Breast samples were classified as normal or PSE based on marinade uptake (high = normal; low = PSE). Total RNA from samples with the highest (n=4) and lowest (n=4) marinade uptake were isolated and sequenced using the Illumina GAIIX platform. Of 21,340 gene loci discovered by RNAseq, 8480 loci completely matched the turkey reference genome, and 480 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate, FDR<0.05) between normal and PSE samples. Two highlights were the genes nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV), upregulated about 38-fold and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4), downregulated 14-fold in PSE samples. Pathway analysis suggested that several biological functions, including carbohydrate metabolism and energy production, were affected by meat quality. Because PDK4 regulates conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, differences in regulation of oxidative metabolism may exist among turkeys. Accelerated early postmortem metabolism would result in faster pH decline in PSE meat. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that decreased expression of PDK4 was associated with lower pH in PSE samples (pH[PSE] = 5.59±0.09, pH[normal] = 5.77±0.17). The RNAseq results provided a greater molecular mechanistic understanding of development of PSE turkey, which will be a foundation for new intervention strategies to prevent development of this defect. Overall design: The mRNA profiles of normal and PSE turkey breast muscle were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx platform. Multiplexing was performed (2 samples/lane). Afterwards, difference in gene expression between normal and PSE samples were tested."	"SRA"	"partial"	"GSE37176, PRJNA158613"

We investigated three male mixed-breed dogs with an ectodermal dysplasia phenotype characterized by marked hypotrichosis, absence of sweat glands and altered dentition with missing and abnormally shaped teeth. Analysis of whole genome sequence data from the three affected dogs and 281 control dogs revealed that the affected dogs shared the same haplotype on a large segment of the X-chromosome, whereas they did not share any large homozygous segments elsewhere in the genome. Unexpectedly, bioinformatic analysis of the sequence data did not reveal any private non-synonymous variant in the affected dogs within the shared haplotype on the X chromosome. Furthermore, no private DNA variants were found in the EDA gene. We therefore performed an RNA-seq experiment on skin biopsies to search for changes in the transcriptome. This analysis revealed that the EDA transcript in the affected dogs lacked 103 nucleotides encoded by exon 2. We speculate that this exon skipping is caused by a genetic variant located in one of the large introns flanking this exon, which was missed by whole genome sequencing with the illumina short read technology. The altered EDA transcript splicing most likely causes the observed XLHED in the affected dogs. These dogs thus offer an excellent opportunity to gain insights into the complex splicing processes required for expression of the EDA gene and other genes with large introns."	"SRA"	"partial"

Some signaling pathways have been implicated in DMVD, including the serotonin and TGF-beta pathways. We sought to identify additional molecular and metabolic pathways that contribute to DMVD using transcriptomic and metabolomic studies. RNA-seq gene expression evaluated on total RNA isolated from left ventricle (LV) and mitral valve (MV) identified 812 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) in LV and 263 DETs in MV. Out of 15 transcripts selected for RT-qPCR validation, we confirmed 13. In addition, serum samples were collected for metabolomic evaluation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was significantly up-regulated in both LV and MV while the level of circulating asymmetrical dimethyl arginine (ADMA), an endogenous NOS inhibitor, was lower in DMVD. Expressions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their endogenous inhibitor tissue inhibitor of matrix metallopeptidases (TIMP) were altered. This study demonstrates transcript and metabolite differences consistent with increased nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, impaired fatty acid transport and oxidation, and increased glucose uptake and glycolysis in DMVD. Our findings are consistent with metabolic conversion in the DMVD heart from oxidative metabolism to glycolysis along with an increased concentration of NO and ROS activity suggesting an alternative signaling effect. Alterations of redox-sensitive NO signaling may play a role in ECM (ECM) homeostasis via modulating MMP and TIMP expression.

In order to identify somatic drivers of canine InvTCC, the complete transcriptome for four tumors and two normal bladders was determined by RNAseq. All tumors harbored a somatic mutation that is homologous to the human BRAF(V600E) mutation, and an identical mutation was present in 87% of canine InvTCC tumors. The mutation was also detectable in the urine sediments of all dogs tested with mutation-positive tumors. Functional experiments suggest that, like human tumors, canine activating BRAF mutations potently stimulate the MAPK pathway. These findings set the stage for canine InvTCC as a powerful system to evaluate BRAF-targeted therapies, as well as therapies designed to overcome resistance, which could enhance treatment of both human and canine cancers"	"SRA"	"partial"

The dwarf phenotype is expressed in heterozygous individuals and rabbits from dwarf breeds homozygous for the wild-type allele are normal rabbits (although smaller when compared to other breeds). Here, we show that the dwarf phenotype is caused by a ~12.1 kb deletion overlapping the promoter region and the first three exons of the HMGA2 gene, leading to gene inactivation.

Among those freshwater habitats, adjacent lake and river populations harbour distinct parasite communities, a recurring ecological difference proposed to drive adaptive differentiation between lake and river stickleback ecotypes. To study the rapid adaptation of sticklebacks to lake and river habitats, we analysed gene expression profiles of 77 whole-transcriptome libraries of two immune-relevant tissues, the head kidney and the spleen, obtained from wild-caught sticklebacks of the two habitat types across multiple geographic locations. Differential expression analyses identified 189 genes showing statistically significant habitat-specific expression patterns among the three European locations. Among those genes, 15 genes are annotated with putative immune functions, and 50 have been experimentally associated with immune-responses in sticklebacks, reinforcing the hypothesis that parasites contribute to adaptive evolution of lake and river sticklebacks. Comparing expression profiles of European sticklebacks to populations in similar habitats in North America, five genes exhibited habitat-specific expression across continents. "	"SRA"	"total"

The extent to which these processes are conserved is unclear, and little is known about methylation outside of mammals, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Neurospora crassa. Utilizing deep bisulfite sequencing, we have quantified DNA methylation in five plant, seven animal, and five fungal genomes. We find that gene body methylation is conserved between plants and animals, whereas selective methylation of transposons has evolved independently in the vertebrate lineage. We show that methylation of plant transposons in the CHG context extends to green algae, and present evidence for RNA-directed DNA methylation of fungal genes. We also show that antagonism between DNA methylation and histone H2A.Z is conserved between plants and animals. Our data demonstrate that extant DNA methylation systems are mosaics of conserved and derived features, and indicate that gene body methylation is an ancient property of eukaryotic genomes.

Here we report a mutation in LTBP2 that causes primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) in domestic cats. We identified a spontaneous form of PCG in cats and established a breeding colony segregating for PCG consistent with fully penetrant, autosomal recessive inheritance of the trait. Elevated intraocular pressure, globe enlargement and elongated ciliary processes were consistently observed in all affected cats by 8 weeks of age. Varying degrees of optic nerve damage resulted by 6 months of age. Although subtle lens zonular instability was a common feature in this cohort, pronounced ectopia lentis was identified in less than 10% of cats examined. Thus, glaucoma in this pedigree is attributed to histologically confirmed arrest in the early post-natal development of the aqueous humor outflow pathways in the anterior segment of the eyes of affected animals. Using a candidate gene approach, significant linage was established on cat chromosome B3 (LOD 18.38, q = 0.00) using tightly linked short tandem repeat (STR) loci to the candidate gene, LTBP2. A 4 base-pair insertion was identified in exon 8 of LTBP2 in affected individuals that generates a frame shift that completely alters the downstream open reading frame and eliminates functional domains. Thus, we describe the first spontaneous and highly penetrant non-rodent model of PCG, identifying a valuable animal model for primary glaucoma that closely resembles the human disease providing valuable insights into mechanisms underlying the disease and a valuable animal model for testing therapies.

We used RNA sequencing coupled with de novo transcriptome assembly, because the Syrian hamster does not have a fully sequenced and annotated reference genome. Libraries for deep sequencing were constructed from poly-A RNA isolated from the spleens or splenic macrophages of uninfected and 28-day L. donovani-infected hamsters (n=4 per group) using standard Illumina protocols. The library quality was confirmed by Agilent Bioanalyzer. Paired-end 50-base sequencing was performed using TruSeq SBS kit v3 (Illumina) on an Illumina HiSeq 1000.The quality of raw sequencing reads was checked using FastQC (v0.10.1). To avoid the contamination of pathogen sequences, we filtered out reads (using the FASTX Toolkit v0.0.13) that aligned to the Leishmania donovani BPK282A1 genome (NCBI BioProject PRJEA61817) using Bowtie 2 (v2.0.0-beta5) under default options. To reduce the effect of low quality reads, we further filtered out artifacts and reads having a phred score <28 in more than 10% of nucleotides using FASTX Toolkit (v0.0.13). Both forward and reverse reads were removed if any of them failed to pass the filters. To obtain a complete transcriptome, we used two steps. First, the cleaned sequencing reads from different spleen samples were pooled together and de novo assembled using Trinity software. Second, the resulting transcriptome was combined with all cleaned reads from hamster spleen and splenic macrophages and the CHO-K1 RefSeq genome to perform a second de novo assembly using BRANCH. We first created a customized reference library using Rattus norvegicus (Rnor_5.0.73) and Mus musculus (GRCm38.73) genomes. We then used BLAST (v 2.2.28+) to align each transcript generated from BRANCH against the customized library to assign it a gene name based upon sequence similarity. An E-value cutoff of <1e-3 was used. Additionally, we compared the Trinity transcripts with the CHO-K1 Ref Seq genome. All the non-Leishmania-like raw sequencing reads were first mapped to our de novo reference genome using Bowtie2 (v2.1.0) with default options, but allowing one read to map to as many as 500 different transcripts. We then measured the expression abundance, count of reads mapped to each transcript, using the software eXpress. To identify differentially expressed transcripts in each experiment, 3 different approaches were applied: exact tests of Robinson and Smyth and generalized linear models with the likelihood ratio test using the BioConductor R package EdgeR, and the Wald test using DESeq2. Only transcripts with at least 1 count per million in at least 3 out of 4 samples in the control or experimental group were included in the analysis. A transcript was considered differentially expressed only when it was identified by all three different approaches. Analysis of differentially expressed transcripts identified a highly inflammatory spleen environment with abundant expression of type I and type II interferon response genes. However, high IFN-? expression was ineffective in directing exclusive M1 macrophage polarization, suppressing M2-associated gene expression, and restraining parasite replication and disease. While many IFN-inducible transcripts were upregulated in the infected spleen, fewer were induced in splenic macrophages in VL suggesting suppression of macrophage responsiveness to activating cytokines. The transcription factor STAT3 was predicted and confirmed to be activated, and found to orchestrate an exuberant counter-regulatory response that favors parasite replication.

While the LP mutation allows for expression of the various patterns, other loci are responsible for modification of the extent of white. Pedigree analysis of families segregating for high levels of patterning (80-100% white hair coat) indicated a single dominant gene (PATN1) as a major effect modifier for LP. Linkage analysis identified a 16 Mbp region on ECA3p associated with PATN1. Whole transcriptome sequencing of skin samples from horses with and without the PATN1 allele was performed to identify genic SNPs for fine mapping. Two Sequenom assays were utilized to genotype 192 individuals from five LP-containing breeds. The initial panel highlighted a 1.6 Mbp region without a clear candidate gene. In the second round of fine-mapping, a SNP in the 3' UTR of RING finger and WD repeat domain 3 (RFWD3) reached a significance level of p=1.063x10-39. Sequencing of RFWD3 did not identify any coding polymorphisms specific to the PATN1 horses. Genotyping of an additional 52 LP animals increased this association to a p-value of 4.68x10-56. An additional 166 horses of breeds not segregating for LP did not contain the PATN1-associated allele. This variant is a strong candidate for PATN1 and may be used for genotyping lp/lp animals."

The study cohort comprised 7 thoroughbred racehorses from a single training yard. Skeletal muscle biopsies were collected at rest from the gluteus medius at two time points: T1 (unconditioned), (9 +/- 0.5 months old) and T2 (conditioned) (20 +/- 0.7 months old). The most highly abundant genes in the muscle transcriptome were those involved in muscle contraction, aerobic respiration and mitochondrial function. A previously unreported over-representation of genes relating to RNA processing, the stress response and proteolysis was observed. Following training 92 tags were differentially expressed of which 74 were annotated. Sixteen genes showed increased expression, including the mitochondrial genes, ACADVL, MRPS21 and SLC25A29. Among the 58 genes with deceased expression MSTN, a negative regulator of muscle growth had the greatest decrease. Functional analysis of all expressed genes using FatiScan revealed an asymmetric distribution of 482 Gene Ontology groups and 18 KEGG pathways.

"In eutherian mammals, dosage compensation of X-linked genes is achieved by X chromosome inactivation. X inactivation is random in embryonic and adult tissues, but imprinted X inactivation (paternal X silencing) has been identified in the extraembryonic membranes of the mouse, rat, and cow.  Few other species have been studied for this trait, and the data from studies of the human placenta have been discordant or inconclusive.  Here, we quantify X inactivation using RNA sequencing of placental tissue from reciprocal hybrids of horse and donkey (mule and hinny).  In placental tissue from the equid hybrids and the horse parent the allelic expression pattern was consistent with random X inactivation, and imprinted X inactivation can clearly be excluded. We characterized horse and donkey XIST gene, and demonstrated that XIST allelic expression in female hybrid placental and fetal tissues is negatively correlated with the other X-linked genes chromosome-wide, which is consistent with the XIST-mediated mechanism of X inactivation discovered previously in mice.  As the most structurally and morphologically diverse organ in mammals, the placenta also appears to show diverse mechanisms for dosage compensation that may result in differences in conceptus development across species.

However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to behavioral plasticity are unclear. Here, we show that the genome dynamically responds to social interactions with multiple waves of transcription associated with distinct molecular functions in the brain of male threespined sticklebacks, a species famous for its behavioral repertoire and evolution. Some biological functions (e.g., hormone activity) peaked soon after a brief territorial challenge and then declined, while others (e.g., immune response) peaked hours afterwards. We identify transcription factors that are predicted to coordinate waves of transcription associated with different components of behavioral plasticity. Next, using H3K27Ac as a marker of chromatin accessibility, we show that a brief territorial intrusion was sufficient to cause rapid and dramatic changes in the epigenome. Finally, we integrate the time course brain gene expression data with a transcriptional regulatory network, and link gene expression to changes in chromatin accessibility. This study reveals rapid and dramatic epigenomic plasticity in response to a brief, highly consequential social interaction. Overall design: Adult males were collected from Putah Creek, a freshwater population, in spring 2013 and maintained in the lab on a 16:8 (L:D) photoperiod and at 18° C in separate 9-liter tanks. Males were provided with nesting material including algae, sand and gravel and were visually isolated from neighbors. All males were in the *territorial* phase of the nesting cycle, i.e. defending a territory. Males were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. Males in the experimental group were presented with a smaller, unrelated male intruder confined to a flask. Males in the control groups were presented with an empty flask. At the same time as a confined intruder was introduced to an experimental male's tank, an empty flask was introduced into a paired control male's tank. After 5 min the flask was removed, and after a predetermined period (see below) males were quickly netted and sacrificed by decapitation within seconds following an IACUC approved protocol (#15077) of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Most of these encode the equine homologs of known protein-coding genes described in other species, yet the potential exists to identify novel and perhaps equine-specific gene structures.  A set of 36 transcripts were prioritized for further study by filtering for levels of expression (depth of RNA-seq read coverage), distance from annotated features in the equine genome, the number of putative exons, and patterns of gene expression between tissues.  From these, four were selected for further investigation based on predicted open reading frames of greater than or equal to 50 amino acids and lack of detectable homology to known genes across species.  Sanger sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons from additional equine samples confirmed expression and structural annotation of each transcript.  Functional predictions were made by conserved domain searches.  A single transcript, expressed in the cerebellum, contains a putative kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, suggesting a potential function associated with zinc finger proteins and transcriptional regulation.  Overall levels of conserved synteny and sequence conservation across a 1MB region surrounding each transcript were approximately 73% compared to the human, canine, and bovine genomes; however, the four loci display some areas of low conservation and sequence inversion in regions that immediately flank these previously unannotated equine transcripts.

The phenotype of equine CVID is similar to that of CVID-affected humans who lack B lymphocytes. We have determined that the loss of B lymphocytes is due to a failure of differentiation in the bone marrow of equine CVID patients. Transcriptome sequencing was undertaken to assess the expression of genes and transcription factors known to be essential for B cell differentiation, and simultaneously obtain a comprehensive view of gene expression in the bone marrow. Analysis of bone marrow mRNA expression from CVID horses revealed a significant decrease in E2A (p < 0.05) and a marked decrease in PAX5 (p < 0.01) expression in comparison to healthy horses. E2A and PAX5 are transcription factors essential to successful B cell differentiation, and are indicative of specific B cell stages.

"SRP051087"	"Equus caballus Transcriptome or Gene expression"	"The physiological changes associated with the varying hormonal environment throughout the oestrous cycle have been analysed in several species. These changes are linked to the many functions the uterus needs to fulfil, such as clearing contaminants introduced via breeding and supporting the development of a foetus. The aim of this study was to generate global gene expression profiles for the equine uterus during oestrus and dioestrus. To achieve this, samples were collected from 5 horses, once during oestrus (follicle > 35mm diameter) and once during dioestrus (5 days post ovulation), and analysed using high throughput RNA-Seq technologies. Genes identified as being differentially expressed between the two cycle stages were further investigated using Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. The expression levels of a total of 1577 genes were found to be significantly up-regulated during oestrus while 1864 genes were expressed at significantly higher levels in dioestrus. Most genes up-regulated during oestrus were associated with the extra-cellular matrix, signal interaction and transduction, cell communication or the immune function, whereas genes expressed at higher levels in dioestrus were most commonly associated with metabolic or transport functions. This correlates well with the physiological functions of the uterus - during oestrus it is expected to be preparing for potential infections facilitated by an open cervix and breeding, while the dioestrous uterus needs to be accommodating to a potential conceptus. These results allow for a more complete understanding of the hormonal influence on gene expression in the equine uterus and provide a valuable baseline for further research in equine reproduction, including analyses of changes associated with infection and inflammation."

The aim of this study was to examine this by means of RNA sequencing. Four days after ovulation, the oviduct epithelial cells ipsilateral and contralateral to the ovulation side from five cyclic and five pregnant mares were collected. mRNA was extracted and samples were sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq-2000 sequencer. Data analysis was performed with the CLC Genomics software and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined (p-value = 0.05 and absolute fold change = 2). ClueGO was used for functional interpretation. A total of 26,991 genes was identified and 253 genes were found to be upregulated and 108 to be downregulated in the pregnant ipsilateral oviduct, when compared to the cyclic ipsilateral oviduct. Comparison of the ipsilateral and the contralateral oviduct indicated 164 DEGs in pregnant mares and 77 DEGs in cyclic mares. Functional enrichment analysis only detected differences in the comparison of pregnant and cyclic ipsilateral oviducts and showed that the equine embryo affects the expression of immune response related genes in the oviduct, with marked upregulation of interferon associated genes. This research represents the foundation for further assessment of the role of specific genes in the early embryo-maternal dialogue of the horse. Overall design: mRNA profiles of epithelial cells of equine oviducts ipsilateral and contralateral to the ovulation side of pregnant and cyclic mares four days after ovulation were examined, resulting in four different conditions (pregnant ipsilateral, pregnant contralateral, cyclic ipsilateral and cyclic contralateral, consisting of five biological replicates each."

Methods: Whole transcriptome profiling of blood was performed for  untrained horses and  horses from which samples were collected during at 3 different periods of training procedure (T1-during intense training period - March, T2- before starts - May and T3 -after flat racing season - October). The muscle transcriptome sequencing was performed for 37 blood samples using Illumina HiScan SQ in 75 single-end cycles. The quantifying transcript abundances was made using the RSEM supported by STAR aligner. The raw reads were aligned to the Equus caballus reference genome. Differentially expressed genes in blood tissue were detected by DESeq2. The RNA-seq results were validated using by qPCR. Results: The increase of the number of DEGs between subsequent training periods has been observed and the highest amount of DEGs was detected between untrained horses (T0) and horses at the end of the racing season (T3) - 440. The comparison of transcriptome of T2 vs T3 and T0 vs T3 showed a significant advantage of up-regulated genes during long-term exercise (up-regulation of 266 and 389 DEGs in T3 period compared T2 and T0; respectively). Our results showed that the largest number of identified genes encoded transcription factors, nucleic acid binding proteins and G-protein modulators, which mainly were transcriptional  activated at the last training phase (T3) . Moreover, in the T3 period the identified DEGs represented genes coded for cytoskeletal proteins including actin cytoskeletal proteins and kinases. The most abundant exercise-upregulated genes were involved in pathways important in regulating the cell cycle (PI3K-Akt signaling pathway), cell communication (cAMP-dependent pathway), proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis as well as immunity processes (Jak-STAT signaling pathway). We also observed exercise induced expression of genes related in regulation of actin cytoskeleton, gluconeogenesis (FoxO signaling pathway; Insulin signaling pathway), glycerophospholipid metabolism and calcium signaling. Conclusions: TOur results allow to identify changes in genes expression profile following training schedule in Arabian horses. Based on comparison analysis of blood transcriptomes, several exercise-regulated pathways and genes most affected by exercise were detected. We pinpointed overrepresented molecular pathways and genes essential for exercise adaptive response via maintaining of body homeostasis. The observed transcriptional activation of such gene as LPGAT1, AGPAT5, PIK3CG, GPD2,  FOXN2, FOXO3, ACVR1B and ACVR2A can be a base for further research in order to identify genes potentially associated with race performance in Arabian horses. Such markers will be essential to choice the training type, and could result in differences in racing performance specific to various breeds.

Methods: Whole transcriptomes between three time points of muscle tissue collection were compared: T0 (untrained horses),  T1 (horses after intense gallop phase) and T2 (at the end of the racing season), in total 23 samples.  The biopsy of gluteus medius muscle was performed by using minimally invasive ProMag™ Ultra Automatic Biopsy Instrument with a 2 mm diameter biopsy needle. The total RNA was isolated using by TriReagent and 300ng was used to  cDNA libraries preparation.  The NGS sequencing was performed on HiScan SQ (Illumina). The quantifying transcript abundances was made using the RSEM supported by STAR aligner. The raw reads were aligned to the Equus caballus reference genome. Differentially expressed genes were detected by DESeq2. The RNA-seq results were validated using by qPCR. Results: To detected differentially expressed genes during training preparing to the flat racing, whole transcriptomes between three time points of muscle tissue collection were compared: T0 (untrained horses),  T1 (horses after intense gallop phase) and T2 (at the end of the racing season). We identified 1168 DEGs between T0 vs T1; 1593 between T1 vs T2 and 763 between T2 vs T0. The analysis for all DEGs allow to detect 11 pathways which ale significant over represented between at last two training periods. The numerous group of exercise-regulated DEGs was related with muscle cell structure and signaling ('focal adhesion', 'adherens juntion' and 'PI3-ATK signaling') and included insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R); insulin receptor (INSR); transforming growth factor beta receptors 1 and 2 (TGFBR1; TGFBR2); vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB);  epidermal growth factor (EGF); hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor D (FIGF). Our results showed that in Arabian horses exercise modified the expression of genes belonging to the 'PPAR signaling pathway' (e.g. PPARA; PPARD; PLIN2); 'calcium signaling pathway' (e.g. PLN; PLCD1; TNNC1; TNNC2) as well as pathways associated with metabolism processes - 'oxidative phosphorylation'; 'fatty acid metabolism'; 'glycolysis/gluconeogenesis' and 'citrate cycle'. Conclusions: Our research allowed to identify the group of exercise-regulated genes which was related with muscle cell structure as well as signaling and pinpointed the significant metabolic processes critical for adaptive response during training. We confirmed that in Arabians, the exercise switch energy generation towards fatty acid utilization, enhance glycogen transport and calcium signaling. The sequencing of skeletal muscle transcriptome allowed to propose the panel of new candidate genes (such as SLC16A1; ME3; ACTN3; PPARa; SH3RF2; TPM3; TNNC1; TNNI3; TGFBR1; TGFBR2; FABP3) potentially related with body homeostasis maintenance and race performance in Arabian horse.

"SRP007347"	"Profiling of differential allelic expression in horse, donkey, mule and hinny placental tissue"	"The discovery of genomic imprinting through studies of manipulated mouse embryos indicated that the paternal genome has a major influence on placental development.  However, previous research has not demonstrated paternal bias in imprinted genes.  We applied RNA sequencing to trophoblast tissue from reciprocal hybrids of horse and donkey, where genotypic differences allowed parent-of-origin identification of most expressed genes.  Using this approach, we identified a core group of 15 ancient imprinted genes of which 10 were paternally expressed.  An additional 78 candidate novel imprinted genes identified by RNA-seq also showed paternal bias.  Pyrosequencing was used to confirm the imprinting status of six of the novel genes, including the insulin receptor (INSR), which may play a role in growth regulation with its reciprocally imprinted ligand, histone acetyltransferase (HAT1), the first example of an imprinted gene involved in chromatin modification, and LY6G6C, the first imprinted gene to be identified in the major histocompatibility complex.  The 78 novel candidate imprinted genes displayed parent-of-origin expression bias in placenta but not fetus, and most showed less than 100% silencing of the imprinted allele.  Some displayed variability in imprinting status among individuals.  This results in a unique epigenetic signature for each placenta that contributes to variation in the intrauterine environment and thus presents the opportunity for natural selection to operate on parent-of-origin differential regulation.  Taken together, these features highlight the plasticity of imprinting in mammals and the central importance of the placenta as a target tissue for genomic imprinting.

By doing RNA-seq on these tissues we do a number of things: (a) assess the level of allele specific expression in Medaka (b) test whether there is any imprinting (parent of origin) in fish.

We observed a ~200-base pair (bp) periodic pattern of genetic variation downstream of transcription start sites; the rate of insertions and deletions longer than 1 bp peaked at positions of approximately  200,  400, and  600 bp, whereas the point mutation rate showed corresponding valleys. This ~200-bp periodicity was correlated with the chromatin structure, with nucleosome occupancy minimized at positions 0,  200,  400, and  600 bp.

Results: We have characterized sequence variation and expression properties of this set of TSSs (which we call ""Nucleocyclic TSSs"") using germline and somatic cells of three medaka (Oryzias latipes) inbred isolates from different locations. We found nucleocyclic TSSs in medaka to be associated with higher gene expression and characterized by a clear boundary in sequence composition with potentially-nucleosome-destabilizing A/T-enrichment upstream (p<1E-60 ) and nucleosome-accommodating C/G-enrichment downstream (p<1E-40 ) that was highly conserved from an ancestor. A substantial genetic distance between the strains facilitated the in-depth analysis of patterns of fixed mutations, revealing a localization-specific equilibrium between the rates of distinct mutation categories that would serve to maintain the conserved sequence anisotropy around TSSs. Downstream of nucleocyclic TSSs, C to T, T to C, and other mutation rates on the sense strand increased around first nucleosome dyads and decreased around first linkers, which contrasted with genomewide mutational patterns around nucleosomes (p<5%). C to T rates are higher than G to A rates around nucleosome associated with germline nucleocyclic TSS sites (p<5%), potentially due to the asymmetric effect of transcription-coupled repair.

"SRP011081"	"Platypus fibroblast and ovary transcriptomes"	"As a result of sex chromosome differentiation from ancestral autosomes, male mammalian cells only contain one X chromosome. It has long been hypothesized that X-linked gene expression levels have become doubled in males to restore dosage balance between the X and autosomes, and that the resulting X overexpression in females then drove the evolution of X inactivation (XCI). However, this model has never been directly tested and patterns and mechanisms of dosage compensation across different mammals and birds generally remain little understood. We have traced the evolution of dosage compensation using extensive transcriptome data from males and females representing all major mammalian lineages and birds. Our analyses suggest that the X has become globally upregulated in marsupials but probably not in placental mammals, where instead at least a subset of autosomal genes interacting with X-linked were downregulated. Thus, different driving forces may underlie the evolution of XCI and the highly efficient equilibration of X expression levels between the sexes observed for both of these lineages. In the egg-laying monotremes and birds, which have homologous sex chromosome systems, partial upregulation of the X (Z in birds) evolved but is largely restricted to the heterogametic sex, which provides an explanation for the partially sex-biased X (Z) expression and lack of global inactivation mechanisms in these lineages. Our findings suggest that dosage reductions imposed by sex chromosome differentiation events in amniotes were resolved in strikingly different ways.

The evolution of mammalian pregnancy is an excellent system in which to study the origin of novelties because extant mammals preserve major stages in the transition from egg-laying to live-birth. To determine the molecular bases of this transition, we characterized the pregnant/gravid uterine transcriptome from tetrapods, including species in the three major mammalian lineages, and used ancestral transcriptome reconstruction to trace the evolutionary history of uterine gene expression. We show that thousands of genes evolved or lost uterine expression during the origins of mammalian pregnancy, including the loss of genes responsible for the mineralization of the eggshell in the Mammalian and Therian stem-lineages, and the recruitment of genes into uterine expression that mediate maternal-fetal communication and maternal immunotolerance of the fetal allograft in the Therian and Eutherian stem-lineages. Our results indicate that one of the defining mammalian novelties evolved through a step-wise process that dramatically changed uterine gene expression, generating a suite of evolutionary innovations that support prolonged gestations.

"DRP000894"	"Abundant Bidirectional Transcription around Transcription Start Sites in Mammals"	"In mammals, more than 60% of the genome is use for transcription for mRNAs and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). A fraction of ncRNAs have been believed to downregulate the corresponding mRNA expression level in a pre- or post- transcriptional manner by forming RNA-RNA duplex structures.To examine the directional properties of transcription at the whole genome level, we performed directional RNA-seq analysis of mouse brain and heart samples. Our analysis revealed that there is only a small fraction of the genome where both the top and bottom strands are utilized for transcription.A significant fraction of transcription start sites (TSSs) of protein-coding genes contain borders that separate antisense- and sense-biased transcription, suggesting that head-to-head transcription at the TSS is more prevalent than previously thought.The expression of the resultant promoter-associated ncRNAs (pancRNAs) tends to occur together with that of the corresponding mRNA in a coordinated manner. A fraction of genes with tissue-specific pancRNAs show a positive correlation between their pancRNA and mRNA expression, which is in accord with the proposed role for pancRNA in facultative gene activation, whereas genes with constitutive expression lack an association with pancRNA. More than 90% of head-to-head type promoters contain CpG islands. Moreover, CCG and CGG repeats are significantly enriched in the upstream regions and downstream regions, respectively, of TSSs located in head-to-head type promoters. Here, we propose that head-to-head transcription from GC-rich sequences regulates gene expression. "	"SRA"	"partial"

Most of these studies, however, estimated gene expression levels using microarray probes designed to hybridize to only a small proportion of each gene. Here we used recently-developed RNA sequencing protocols, which side-step this limitation, to assess intra- and inter-species variation in gene regulatory processes in considerably more detail than was previously possible. Specifically, we used RNAseq to study transcript levels in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques, using liver RNA samples from three males and three females from each species. Our approach allowed us to identify a large number of genes whose expression levels likely evolve under natural selection in primates. These include a subset of genes with conserved sexually dimorphic expression patterns across the three species, which we found to be enriched for genes involved in lipid metabolism. Our data also suggest that while alternative splicing is tightly regulated within and between species, sex-specific and lineage-specific changes in the expression of different splice forms are also frequent. Intriguingly, among genes in which a change in exon usage occurred exclusively in the human lineage, we found an enrichment of genes involved in anatomical structure and morphogenesis, raising the possibility that differences in the regulation of alternative splicing have been an important force in human evolution.

We found the genes with expression changes in autism are significantly overlapped with genes showing human-specific developmental profile. A major pattern of the overlapped genes reflects the aberrant acceleration of synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation followed by premature synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex of autism patients. This pattern involves the same developmental program that controls human-specific extension of cortical synaptogenesis in healthy individuals. Taken together, these findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying autistic phenotype and provide potential targets for clinical intervention.

To comprehensively study the mechanism of marsupial XCI, we profiled parent-of-origin-specific-allele expression, DNA methylation, and histone modifications in opossum fetal brain and extra-embryonic membranes. The majority (152/176) of X-linked genes exhibited paternally imprinted expression with nearly 100% maternal allele expression, whereas 24 loci (14%) escaped inactivation showing varying levels of biallelic expression. In addition to regulation by the non-coding RSX transcript, strong depletion of H3K27me3 at escaper gene loci indicates that histone states also influence opossum XCI.

As such, identifying the origins of variation is a fundamental goal of biology. We investigated the link between gene interactions and variation in gene expression among individuals and species, using the mammalian limb as a model system. We first built interaction networks for key genes regulating early (outgrowth; E9.5-11) and late (expansion and elongation; E11-13) limb development in mouse. This resulted in an Early (ESN) and Late (LSN) Stage Network. Computational perturbations of these networks suggest that the ESN is more robust. We then quantified levels of the same key genes among mouse individuals, and found that they vary less at earlier limb stages and that variation in gene expression is heritable. Finally, we quantified variation in gene expression levels among four mammals with divergent limbs (bat, opossum, mouse and pig), and found that levels vary less among species at earlier limb stages. We also found that variation in gene expression levels among individuals and species are correlated for earlier and later limb development. In conclusion, results are consistent with the robustness of the ESN buffering among-individual variation in gene expression levels early in mammalian limb development, and constraining the evolution of early limb development among mammalian species.

The initial exposure caused two behavioral effects at the individual level: an increase in the intensity of aggression toward a second intruder at 30 and 60 minutes, and an increased probability of responding aggressively toward a second intruder that persisted for two hours. The shorter-lived response was associated with one pattern of gene expression in the mushroom bodies, highlighted by genes related to cytoskeleton remodeling. The longer-lived response was associated with a different pattern; highlighted by genes related to hormones, stress response and transcription factors. Histone profiling revealed few changes in chromatin accessibility in response to social challenge; most differentially expressed genes were *ready* to be activated.
