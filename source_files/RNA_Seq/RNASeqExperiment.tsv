"GSE30352"	"The evolution of gene expression levels in mammalian organs"	"Changes in gene expression are thought to underlie many of the phenotypic differences between species. However, large-scale analyses of gene expression evolution were until recently prevented by technological limitations. Here we report the sequencing of polyadenylated RNA from six organs across ten species that represent all major mammalian lineages (placentals, marsupials and monotremes) and birds (the evolutionary outgroup), with the goal of understanding the dynamics of mammalian transcriptome evolution. We show that the rate of gene expression evolution varies among organs, lineages and chromosomes, owing to differences in selective pressures: transcriptome change was slow in nervous tissues and rapid in testes, slower in rodents than in apes and monotremes, and rapid for the X chromosome right after its formation. Although gene expression evolution in mammals was strongly shaped by purifying selection, we identify numerous potentially selectively driven expression switches, which occurred at different rates across lineages and tissues and which probably contributed to the specific organ biology of various mammals. Our transcriptome data provide a valuable resource for functional and evolutionary analyses of mammalian genomes."	"GEO"	"total"

"GSE41338"	"The evolutionary landscape of alternative splicing in vertebrate species"	"How species with similar repertoires of protein coding genes differ so dramatically at the phenotypic level is poorly understood. From comparing the transcriptomes of multiple organs from vertebrate species spanning ~350 million years of evolution, we observe significant differences in alternative splicing complexity between the main vertebrate lineages, with the highest complexity in the primate lineage. Moreover, within as little as six million years, the splicing profiles of physiologically-equivalent organs have diverged to the extent that they are more strongly related to the identity of a species than they are to organ type. Most vertebrate species-specific splicing patterns are governed by the highly variable use of a largely conserved cis-regulatory code. However, a smaller number of pronounced species-dependent splicing changes are predicted to remodel interactions involving factors acting at multiple steps in gene regulation. These events are expected to further contribute to the dramatic diversification of alternative splicing as well as to other gene regulatory changes that contribute to phenotypic differences among vertebrate species."

"GSE41637"	"Evolutionary dynamics of gene and isoform regulation in mammalian tissues"	"Most mammalian genes produce multiple distinct mRNAs through alternative splicing, but the extent of splicing conservation is not clear. To assess tissue-specific transcriptome variation across mammals, we sequenced cDNA from 9 tissues from 4 mammals and one bird in biological triplicate, at unprecedented depth. We find that while tissue-specific gene expression programs are largely conserved, alternative splicing is well conserved in only a subset of tissues and is frequently lineage-specific. Thousands of novel, lineage-specific and conserved alternative exons were identified; widely conserved alternative exons had signatures of binding by MBNL, PTB, RBFOX, STAR and TIA family splicing factors, implicating them as ancestral mammalian splicing regulators. Our data also indicates that alternative splicing is often used to alter protein phosphorylatability, delimiting the scope of kinase signaling."	"GEO"	"total"

We analyzed the poly- adenylated transcriptomes of 8 organs (cortex/whole brain without cerebellum, cerebellum, heart, kidney, liver, placenta, ovary and testis) and 11 species (human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, macaque, mouse, opossum, platypus, chicken and the frog Xenopus tropicalis), which shared a common ancestor ~370 millions of years (MY) ago. Our dataset included 47 strand-specific samples, which allowed us to confirm the orientation of gene predictions and to address the evolution of sense-antisense transcripts.

"GSE43721"	"Cellular source and mechanisms of high transcriptome complexity in the mammalian testis (RNA-Seq organs)"	"Understanding the extent of genomic transcription and its functional relevance is a central goal in genomics research. However, detailed genome-wide investigations of transcriptome complexities in major mammalian organs and their underlying cellular sources, transcriptional mechanisms, and functional relevance have been scarce. Here we first show, using extensive RNA-seq data, that transcription of both functional and nonfunctional genomic elements is substantially more widespread in the testis than in other organs across representative mammals. By scrutinizing the transcriptomes of all main testicular cell types in the mouse, we then reveal that meiotic spermatocytes and especially post-meiotic round spermatids have remarkably diverse transcriptomes, which explains the high transcriptome complexity of the testis as a whole. The widespread transcriptional activity in spermatocytes and spermatids encompasses protein-coding genes and long noncoding RNA genes but also poorly conserved intergenic sequences, suggesting that much of it is not of immediate functional relevance. Rather, our analyses of genome-wide epigenetic data show that this prevalent transcription, which apparently promoted the birth of new genes during evolution, results from a highly permissive chromatin state during and after meiosis that may ultimately facilitate the replacement of histones by protamines during late spermatogenesis."

Here, we utilized Illumina sequencing technology to determine differential expression patterns for both zebrafish IRFs and type-I IFNs during two stages of SVCV infection, i.e. 6h and 24h post-infection. For 12 zebrafish IRFs, we identified DrIRF1 mRNA as one of the most abundant in normal tissues and also in SVCV-infected tissues, but DrIRF11 had a very weak basal expression and was almost not induced by SVCV infection. We also identified the highly basal expression of DrIRF7, which together with DrIRF3, was highly induced by SVCV infection.

"GSE71681"	"Yap and Taz regulate retinal pigment epithelial cell fate"	"The optic vesicle comprises a pool of bi-potential progenitor cells from which the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and neural retina fates segregate during ocular morphogenesis. Several transcription factors and signaling pathways have been shown to be important for RPE maintenance and differentiation, but an understanding of the initial fate specification and determination of this ocular cell type is lacking. We show that Yap/Taz-Tead activity is necessary and sufficient for optic vesicle progenitors to adopt RPE identity in zebrafish. A Teadresponsive transgene is expressed within the domain of the optic cup from which RPE arises, and Yap immunoreactivity localizes to the nuclei of prospective RPE cells. yap (yap1) mutants lack a subset of RPE cells and/or exhibit coloboma. Loss of RPE in yap mutants is exacerbated in combination with taz (wwtr1) mutant alleles such that, when Yap and Taz are both absent, optic vesicle progenitor cells completely lose their ability to form RPE. The mechanism of Yap dependent RPE cell type determination is reliant on both nuclear localization of Yap and interaction with a Tead co-factor. In contrast to loss of Yap and Taz, overexpression of either protein within optic vesicle progenitors leads to ectopic pigmentation in a dosagedependent manner. Overall, this study identifies Yap and Taz as key early regulators of RPE genesis and provides a mechanistic framework for understanding the congenital ocular defects of Sveinsson's chorioretinal atrophy and congenital retinal coloboma."

"#GSE38397"	"Comparative oncogenomic analysis of copy number alterations in human and zebrafish tumors enables cancer driver discovery"	"The identification of cancer drivers is a major goal of current cancer research. Finding driver genes within large chromosomal events is especially challenging because such alterations encompass many genes. Previously, we demonstrated that zebrafish malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are highly aneuploid, much like human tumors. In this study, we examined 147 zebrafish MPNSTs by massively parallel sequencing and identified both large and focal copy number alterations (CNAs). Given the low degree of conserved synteny between fish and mammals, we reasoned that comparative analyses of CNAs from fish versus human MPNSTs would enable elimination of a large proportion of passenger mutations, especially on large CNAs. Accordingly, we found less than one third of the human CNA genes were co-gained or co-lost in zebrafish, dramatically narrowing the list of candidate cancer drivers for both focal and large CNAs. We conclude that zebrafish-human comparative analysis represents a powerful, and broadly applicable, tool to enrich for evolutionarily conserved cancer drivers. --- This filing comprises data related to GEO entry GSE23666 (*Highly Aneuploid Zebrafish Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors have Genetic Alterations Similar to Human Cancers*), representing a followup study."

However, the cellular and molecular drivers of this evolutionary transition remain unknown for most mammal groups. Here, we identify such drivers in the living marsupial opossum Monodelphis domestica, whose MC transformation during development anatomically mirrors the evolutionary transformation observed in fossils. Specifically, we link increases in cellular apoptosis and TGF-BR2 signalling to MC breakdown in opossums. We demonstrate that a simple change in TGF-b signalling is sufficient to inhibit MC breakdown during opossum development, indicating that changes in TGF-b signalling might be key during mammalian evolution. Furthermore, the apoptosis that we observe during opossum MC breakdown does not seemingly occur in mouse, consistent with homoplastic DMME evolution in the marsupial and placental lineages."

Atlantic salmon are of considerable economic, social and environmental importance. Salmonids contribute to local and global economies through aquaculture, wild stock fisheries and recreational sport fisheries. In addition, they are a traditional food source for aboriginal peoples and play a central role in their culture. Salmon and trout are sentinel species for monitoring the aquatic environment, and therefore they are used extensively for eco-toxicology studies. Importantly, the common ancestor of salmon and trout experienced a whole genome duplication (60-100MYA), and modern species may be considered pseudo tetraploid as they are well along the process of reverting to a stable diploid state. There is a large salmonid research community working on the biology, life histories, population dynamics, biogeography, phylogenetic relationships, physiology and nutrition of salmonids. No other species group of fishes receives such comprehensive commercial and scientific attention. p An International Collaboration to Sequence the Atlantic Salmon Genome (ICSASG), representing researchers, funding agencies and industry from Canada, Chile and Norway, was formed to undertake a comprehensive genome sequence that would benefit all salmonids. p Note: Double haploid individual chosen for sequencing"	"SRA"	"partial"	"PRJNA72713"

"#SRP002394"	"An Atlas of Bovine Gene Expression Reveals Novel Distinctive Tissue Characteristics and Evidence for Improving Genome Annotation"	"Background: A comprehensive transcriptome survey, or *gene atlas*, provides information essential for a complete understanding of the genomic biology of an organism. We present an atlas of RNA abundance for 92 adult, juvenile and fetal cattle tissues and 3 cattle cell lines. Results: The Bovine Gene Atlas was generated from 7.2 million unique digital gene expression tag sequences (300.2 million total raw tag sequences), from which 1.59 million unique tag sequences were identified that mapped to the bovine genome accounting for 85% of the total raw tag abundance. Filtering these tags yielded 87,764 unique tag sequences that unambiguously mapped to 16,517 annotated protein-coding loci in the genome accounting for 45% of the total raw tag abundance. Clustering of tissues based on tag abundance profiles generally confirmed ontology classification based on anatomy. There were 5,429 constitutively expressed loci and 3,445 constitutively expressed unique tag sequences mapping outside annotated gene boundaries that represent a resource for enhancing current gene models. Physical measures such as inferred transcript length or antisense tag abundance identified tissues with atypical transcriptional tag profiles. We report for the first time the tissue specific variation in the proportion of mitochondrial transcriptional tag abundance. The Bovine Gene Atlas can be examined at http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/bovineatlas . Conclusions: The Bovine Gene Atlas is the deepest and broadest transcriptome survey of any livestock genome to date. Commonalities and variation in sense and antisense transcript tag profiles identified in different tissues facilitate the examination of the relationship between gene expression, tissue, and gene function. Overall design: An atlas of mRNA abundance for 92 adult, juvenile and fetal cattle tissues and 3 cattle cell lines."	"GEO"	"partial"	"GSE21544; discarded, DpnII tag-based libraries"

Surprisingly, over half of euchromatic TEs show spread of repressive epigenetic marks to nearby DNA, resulting in differential epigenetic states of homologous genic alleles and, in return, selection against TEs. Interestingly, compared to D. melanogaster, the lower TE content in D. simulans is correlated with stronger epigenetic effects of TEs and higher levels of host genetic factors known to promote epigenetic silencing. We conclude that the epigenetic effects of euchromatic TEs, and host genetic factors modulating such effects, play a critical role in the population dynamics of TEs within and between species.

In this study, we measured the gene-expression profile of retinas microdissected from a zebrafish pde6cw59 (pde6c) mutant. Its retinas display not only photoreceptor degeneration but also issues in other cell types starting from 4 days postfertilization (dpf). To capture these initial changes, we subjected pde6c and wild-type (WT) retinas at 5 dpf to RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The sequencing analyses indicate that the RNA-Seq dataset was of high quality. We also validated the RNA-Seq results by Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) of seven phototransduction genes. We found that the fold changes of these genes measured by RT-qPCR highly correlated to those measured by RNA-Seq.

"SRP094623"	"Anguilla anguilla Transcriptome or Gene expression"	"Understanding the mechanisms underlying morphological/phenotypic dimorphism and plasticity, including the genomic basis and links to ecological influences, remains one of the major challenges in evolutionary biology. One prime example of phenotypically plastic species distributed along various environmental gradients is the European eel, Anguilla anguilla. At the juvenile (yellow eel) stage of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla), two morphotypes are found: broad- and narrow-heads. This dimorphism has been linked to dietary differences, with broad-heads feeding on harder and larger prey than narrow-heads. However, recent research showed that both morphotypes could already be distinguished at the glass eel stage, the non-feeding predecessor of the yellow eel stage, implying that factors other than trophic segregation play a role in the development of this head shape dimorphism. Here, we used gene transcription profiling (RNAseq) to identify significantly differential expressed genes between broad- and narrow-headed glass eels. Identification of these genes would strongly increase our understanding of the mechanism behind this dimorphism and its ecological implications. We found 260 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between the morphotypes, of which most were related to defense and immune responses. Interestingly, two genes involved in growth (soma and igf2) were significantly up-regulated in narrow-heads, while also nine genes involved in chemotaxis showed a significant differential expression. As such, we found support for the observation that head shape is also associated with somatic growth, with fast-growing eels developing a narrower head. Additionally, observations in the wild have shown that slow-growers prefer freshwater, while fast-growers prefer brackish water. The differential expression of genes involved in chemotaxis indeed seems to indicate that glass eel growth rate and habitat choice are related to each other. We hence hypothesize that two levels of segregations could take place in the European eel: first according to habitat choice, secondly according to feeding preference."	"SRA"	"total"	"PRJNA355998"

We identified 10,813 lncRNAs in Sus scrofa, of which 9,075 are novel. 57% of these lncRNAs were conserved in both human and mouse. These conserved lncRNAs tend to be more tissue-specific than pig-specific lncRNAs, and enriched in reproducible organs (i.e. testis and ovary). We characterized a group of lncRNAs potentially involved in the skeletal muscle development. One such lncRNA, a homolog of maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3), was specifically expressed in the skeletal muscle at early developmental stage. And its expression pattern is conserved in pig and mouse. By over-expressing and knocking down MEG3 in mouse myoblast cell lines, we demonstrated its novel function as a myoblast proliferation suppressor.

Recent genome-wide studies in human and mouse have annotated lncRNAs expressed in cell lines and adult tissues, but a systematic analysis of lncRNAs expressed during vertebrate embryogenesis has been elusive. To identify lncRNAs with potential functions in vertebrate embryogenesis, we performed a time series of RNA-Seq experiments at eight stages during early zebrafish development. We reconstructed 56,535 high-confidence transcripts in 28,912 loci, recovering the vast majority of expressed RefSeq transcripts, while identifying thousands of novel isoforms and expressed loci. We defined a stringent set of 1,133 non-coding multi-exonic transcripts expressed during embryogenesis. These include long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs), intronic overlapping lncRNAs, exonic antisense overlapping lncRNAs, and precursors for small RNAs (sRNAs). Zebrafish lncRNAs share many of the characteristics of their mammalian counterparts: relatively short length, low exon number, low expression, and conservation levels comparable to introns. Subsets of lncRNAs carry chromatin signatures characteristic of genes with developmental functions. The temporal expression profile of lncRNAs revealed two novel properties: lncRNAs are expressed in narrower time windows than protein-coding genes and are specifically enriched in early-stage embryos. In addition, several lncRNAs show tissue-specific expression and distinct subcellular localization patterns. Integrative computational analyses associated individual lncRNAs with specific pathways and functions, ranging from cell cycle regulation to morphogenesis. Our study provides the first comprehensive identification of lncRNAs in a vertebrate embryo and forms the foundation for future genetic, genomic and evolutionary studies.

"SRP012154"	"Next generation sequencing reveals differentially expressed genes associated with development of PSE turkey meat."	"The success of turkey breeding for rapid growth rate and larger breast size has coincided with an increasing incidence of a meat quality defect described as pale, soft and exudative (PSE). We hypothesized that this defect, which is associated with an abnormally rapid rate of postmortem metabolism, derives from altered expression of genes involved in metabolic regulation. Our objective was to use deep transcriptome RNA sequence analysis (RNAseq) to identify differentially expressed genes between normal and PSE turkey breasts. Following harvest of turkey breasts (n = 43), the pH at 15 min post-slaughter and percent marinade uptake at 24h post-slaughter were determined. Breast samples were classified as normal or PSE based on marinade uptake (high = normal; low = PSE). Total RNA from samples with the highest (n=4) and lowest (n=4) marinade uptake were isolated and sequenced using the Illumina GAIIX platform. Of 21,340 gene loci discovered by RNAseq, 8480 loci completely matched the turkey reference genome, and 480 genes were differentially expressed (false discovery rate, FDR<0.05) between normal and PSE samples. Two highlights were the genes nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV), upregulated about 38-fold and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4), downregulated 14-fold in PSE samples. Pathway analysis suggested that several biological functions, including carbohydrate metabolism and energy production, were affected by meat quality. Because PDK4 regulates conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, differences in regulation of oxidative metabolism may exist among turkeys. Accelerated early postmortem metabolism would result in faster pH decline in PSE meat. This hypothesis was supported by the fact that decreased expression of PDK4 was associated with lower pH in PSE samples (pH[PSE] = 5.59±0.09, pH[normal] = 5.77±0.17). The RNAseq results provided a greater molecular mechanistic understanding of development of PSE turkey, which will be a foundation for new intervention strategies to prevent development of this defect. Overall design: The mRNA profiles of normal and PSE turkey breast muscle were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina GAIIx platform. Multiplexing was performed (2 samples/lane). Afterwards, difference in gene expression between normal and PSE samples were tested."	"SRA"	"partial"	"GSE37176, PRJNA158613"

We investigated three male mixed-breed dogs with an ectodermal dysplasia phenotype characterized by marked hypotrichosis, absence of sweat glands and altered dentition with missing and abnormally shaped teeth. Analysis of whole genome sequence data from the three affected dogs and 281 control dogs revealed that the affected dogs shared the same haplotype on a large segment of the X-chromosome, whereas they did not share any large homozygous segments elsewhere in the genome. Unexpectedly, bioinformatic analysis of the sequence data did not reveal any private non-synonymous variant in the affected dogs within the shared haplotype on the X chromosome. Furthermore, no private DNA variants were found in the EDA gene. We therefore performed an RNA-seq experiment on skin biopsies to search for changes in the transcriptome. This analysis revealed that the EDA transcript in the affected dogs lacked 103 nucleotides encoded by exon 2. We speculate that this exon skipping is caused by a genetic variant located in one of the large introns flanking this exon, which was missed by whole genome sequencing with the illumina short read technology. The altered EDA transcript splicing most likely causes the observed XLHED in the affected dogs. These dogs thus offer an excellent opportunity to gain insights into the complex splicing processes required for expression of the EDA gene and other genes with large introns."	"SRA"	"partial"

Some signaling pathways have been implicated in DMVD, including the serotonin and TGF-beta pathways. We sought to identify additional molecular and metabolic pathways that contribute to DMVD using transcriptomic and metabolomic studies. RNA-seq gene expression evaluated on total RNA isolated from left ventricle (LV) and mitral valve (MV) identified 812 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) in LV and 263 DETs in MV. Out of 15 transcripts selected for RT-qPCR validation, we confirmed 13. In addition, serum samples were collected for metabolomic evaluation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was significantly up-regulated in both LV and MV while the level of circulating asymmetrical dimethyl arginine (ADMA), an endogenous NOS inhibitor, was lower in DMVD. Expressions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their endogenous inhibitor tissue inhibitor of matrix metallopeptidases (TIMP) were altered. This study demonstrates transcript and metabolite differences consistent with increased nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, impaired fatty acid transport and oxidation, and increased glucose uptake and glycolysis in DMVD. Our findings are consistent with metabolic conversion in the DMVD heart from oxidative metabolism to glycolysis along with an increased concentration of NO and ROS activity suggesting an alternative signaling effect. Alterations of redox-sensitive NO signaling may play a role in ECM (ECM) homeostasis via modulating MMP and TIMP expression.

Methods: 6 male adult CFD and 6 Beagles were chosen at random with the similarities in good health, weight and other aspects. Separately, 3 of these two breeds were freely selected for the stress exposure via intermittent electrical stimulation and restraint stress, while the other 3 of these two breeds were non-disposed for normal control.The details for the disposal of dogs were: every morning dogs were restrained and electrical stimulations were exerted with a stable current of 10 mA for 6 s and then with a 6 s interval, lasting for 20 min every day.

In order to identify somatic drivers of canine InvTCC, the complete transcriptome for four tumors and two normal bladders was determined by RNAseq. All tumors harbored a somatic mutation that is homologous to the human BRAF(V600E) mutation, and an identical mutation was present in 87% of canine InvTCC tumors. The mutation was also detectable in the urine sediments of all dogs tested with mutation-positive tumors. Functional experiments suggest that, like human tumors, canine activating BRAF mutations potently stimulate the MAPK pathway. These findings set the stage for canine InvTCC as a powerful system to evaluate BRAF-targeted therapies, as well as therapies designed to overcome resistance, which could enhance treatment of both human and canine cancers"	"SRA"	"partial"

The dwarf phenotype is expressed in heterozygous individuals and rabbits from dwarf breeds homozygous for the wild-type allele are normal rabbits (although smaller when compared to other breeds). Here, we show that the dwarf phenotype is caused by a ~12.1 kb deletion overlapping the promoter region and the first three exons of the HMGA2 gene, leading to gene inactivation.

Among those freshwater habitats, adjacent lake and river populations harbour distinct parasite communities, a recurring ecological difference proposed to drive adaptive differentiation between lake and river stickleback ecotypes. To study the rapid adaptation of sticklebacks to lake and river habitats, we analysed gene expression profiles of 77 whole-transcriptome libraries of two immune-relevant tissues, the head kidney and the spleen, obtained from wild-caught sticklebacks of the two habitat types across multiple geographic locations. Differential expression analyses identified 189 genes showing statistically significant habitat-specific expression patterns among the three European locations. Among those genes, 15 genes are annotated with putative immune functions, and 50 have been experimentally associated with immune-responses in sticklebacks, reinforcing the hypothesis that parasites contribute to adaptive evolution of lake and river sticklebacks. Comparing expression profiles of European sticklebacks to populations in similar habitats in North America, five genes exhibited habitat-specific expression across continents."	"SRA"	"total"

The extent to which these processes are conserved is unclear, and little is known about methylation outside of mammals, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Neurospora crassa. Utilizing deep bisulfite sequencing, we have quantified DNA methylation in five plant, seven animal, and five fungal genomes. We find that gene body methylation is conserved between plants and animals, whereas selective methylation of transposons has evolved independently in the vertebrate lineage. We show that methylation of plant transposons in the CHG context extends to green algae, and present evidence for RNA-directed DNA methylation of fungal genes. We also show that antagonism between DNA methylation and histone H2A.Z is conserved between plants and animals. Our data demonstrate that extant DNA methylation systems are mosaics of conserved and derived features, and indicate that gene body methylation is an ancient property of eukaryotic genomes.

Here we report a mutation in LTBP2 that causes primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) in domestic cats. We identified a spontaneous form of PCG in cats and established a breeding colony segregating for PCG consistent with fully penetrant, autosomal recessive inheritance of the trait. Elevated intraocular pressure, globe enlargement and elongated ciliary processes were consistently observed in all affected cats by 8 weeks of age. Varying degrees of optic nerve damage resulted by 6 months of age. Although subtle lens zonular instability was a common feature in this cohort, pronounced ectopia lentis was identified in less than 10% of cats examined. Thus, glaucoma in this pedigree is attributed to histologically confirmed arrest in the early post-natal development of the aqueous humor outflow pathways in the anterior segment of the eyes of affected animals. Using a candidate gene approach, significant linage was established on cat chromosome B3 (LOD 18.38, q = 0.00) using tightly linked short tandem repeat (STR) loci to the candidate gene, LTBP2. A 4 base-pair insertion was identified in exon 8 of LTBP2 in affected individuals that generates a frame shift that completely alters the downstream open reading frame and eliminates functional domains. Thus, we describe the first spontaneous and highly penetrant non-rodent model of PCG, identifying a valuable animal model for primary glaucoma that closely resembles the human disease providing valuable insights into mechanisms underlying the disease and a valuable animal model for testing therapies.

We used RNA sequencing coupled with de novo transcriptome assembly, because the Syrian hamster does not have a fully sequenced and annotated reference genome. Libraries for deep sequencing were constructed from poly-A RNA isolated from the spleens or splenic macrophages of uninfected and 28-day L. donovani-infected hamsters (n=4 per group) using standard Illumina protocols. The library quality was confirmed by Agilent Bioanalyzer. Paired-end 50-base sequencing was performed using TruSeq SBS kit v3 (Illumina) on an Illumina HiSeq 1000.The quality of raw sequencing reads was checked using FastQC (v0.10.1). To avoid the contamination of pathogen sequences, we filtered out reads (using the FASTX Toolkit v0.0.13) that aligned to the Leishmania donovani BPK282A1 genome (NCBI BioProject PRJEA61817) using Bowtie 2 (v2.0.0-beta5) under default options. To reduce the effect of low quality reads, we further filtered out artifacts and reads having a phred score <28 in more than 10% of nucleotides using FASTX Toolkit (v0.0.13). Both forward and reverse reads were removed if any of them failed to pass the filters. To obtain a complete transcriptome, we used two steps. First, the cleaned sequencing reads from different spleen samples were pooled together and de novo assembled using Trinity software. Second, the resulting transcriptome was combined with all cleaned reads from hamster spleen and splenic macrophages and the CHO-K1 RefSeq genome to perform a second de novo assembly using BRANCH. We first created a customized reference library using Rattus norvegicus (Rnor_5.0.73) and Mus musculus (GRCm38.73) genomes. We then used BLAST (v 2.2.28+) to align each transcript generated from BRANCH against the customized library to assign it a gene name based upon sequence similarity. An E-value cutoff of <1e-3 was used. Additionally, we compared the Trinity transcripts with the CHO-K1 Ref Seq genome. All the non-Leishmania-like raw sequencing reads were first mapped to our de novo reference genome using Bowtie2 (v2.1.0) with default options, but allowing one read to map to as many as 500 different transcripts. We then measured the expression abundance, count of reads mapped to each transcript, using the software eXpress. To identify differentially expressed transcripts in each experiment, 3 different approaches were applied: exact tests of Robinson and Smyth and generalized linear models with the likelihood ratio test using the BioConductor R package EdgeR, and the Wald test using DESeq2. Only transcripts with at least 1 count per million in at least 3 out of 4 samples in the control or experimental group were included in the analysis. A transcript was considered differentially expressed only when it was identified by all three different approaches. Analysis of differentially expressed transcripts identified a highly inflammatory spleen environment with abundant expression of type I and type II interferon response genes. However, high IFN-? expression was ineffective in directing exclusive M1 macrophage polarization, suppressing M2-associated gene expression, and restraining parasite replication and disease. While many IFN-inducible transcripts were upregulated in the infected spleen, fewer were induced in splenic macrophages in VL suggesting suppression of macrophage responsiveness to activating cytokines. The transcription factor STAT3 was predicted and confirmed to be activated, and found to orchestrate an exuberant counter-regulatory response that favors parasite replication.

While the LP mutation allows for expression of the various patterns, other loci are responsible for modification of the extent of white. Pedigree analysis of families segregating for high levels of patterning (80-100% white hair coat) indicated a single dominant gene (PATN1) as a major effect modifier for LP. Linkage analysis identified a 16 Mbp region on ECA3p associated with PATN1. Whole transcriptome sequencing of skin samples from horses with and without the PATN1 allele was performed to identify genic SNPs for fine mapping. Two Sequenom assays were utilized to genotype 192 individuals from five LP-containing breeds. The initial panel highlighted a 1.6 Mbp region without a clear candidate gene. In the second round of fine-mapping, a SNP in the 3' UTR of RING finger and WD repeat domain 3 (RFWD3) reached a significance level of p=1.063x10-39. Sequencing of RFWD3 did not identify any coding polymorphisms specific to the PATN1 horses. Genotyping of an additional 52 LP animals increased this association to a p-value of 4.68x10-56. An additional 166 horses of breeds not segregating for LP did not contain the PATN1-associated allele. This variant is a strong candidate for PATN1 and may be used for genotyping lp/lp animals."

The study cohort comprised 7 thoroughbred racehorses from a single training yard. Skeletal muscle biopsies were collected at rest from the gluteus medius at two time points: T1 (unconditioned), (9 +/- 0.5 months old) and T2 (conditioned) (20 +/- 0.7 months old). The most highly abundant genes in the muscle transcriptome were those involved in muscle contraction, aerobic respiration and mitochondrial function. A previously unreported over-representation of genes relating to RNA processing, the stress response and proteolysis was observed. Following training 92 tags were differentially expressed of which 74 were annotated. Sixteen genes showed increased expression, including the mitochondrial genes, ACADVL, MRPS21 and SLC25A29.

"In eutherian mammals, dosage compensation of X-linked genes is achieved by X chromosome inactivation. X inactivation is random in embryonic and adult tissues, but imprinted X inactivation (paternal X silencing) has been identified in the extraembryonic membranes of the mouse, rat, and cow.  Few other species have been studied for this trait, and the data from studies of the human placenta have been discordant or inconclusive.  Here, we quantify X inactivation using RNA sequencing of placental tissue from reciprocal hybrids of horse and donkey (mule and hinny).  In placental tissue from the equid hybrids and the horse parent the allelic expression pattern was consistent with random X inactivation, and imprinted X inactivation can clearly be excluded. We characterized horse and donkey XIST gene, and demonstrated that XIST allelic expression in female hybrid placental and fetal tissues is negatively correlated with the other X-linked genes chromosome-wide, which is consistent with the XIST-mediated mechanism of X inactivation discovered previously in mice.  As the most structurally and morphologically diverse organ in mammals, the placenta also appears to show diverse mechanisms for dosage compensation that may result in differences in conceptus development across species.

However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to behavioral plasticity are unclear. Here, we show that the genome dynamically responds to social interactions with multiple waves of transcription associated with distinct molecular functions in the brain of male threespined sticklebacks, a species famous for its behavioral repertoire and evolution. Some biological functions (e.g., hormone activity) peaked soon after a brief territorial challenge and then declined, while others (e.g., immune response) peaked hours afterwards. We identify transcription factors that are predicted to coordinate waves of transcription associated with different components of behavioral plasticity. Next, using H3K27Ac as a marker of chromatin accessibility, we show that a brief territorial intrusion was sufficient to cause rapid and dramatic changes in the epigenome. Finally, we integrate the time course brain gene expression data with a transcriptional regulatory network, and link gene expression to changes in chromatin accessibility. This study reveals rapid and dramatic epigenomic plasticity in response to a brief, highly consequential social interaction. Overall design: Adult males were collected from Putah Creek, a freshwater population, in spring 2013 and maintained in the lab on a 16:8 (L:D) photoperiod and at 18° C in separate 9-liter tanks. Males were provided with nesting material including algae, sand and gravel and were visually isolated from neighbors. All males were in the *territorial* phase of the nesting cycle, i.e. defending a territory. Males were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. Males in the experimental group were presented with a smaller, unrelated male intruder confined to a flask. Males in the control groups were presented with an empty flask. At the same time as a confined intruder was introduced to an experimental male's tank, an empty flask was introduced into a paired control male's tank. After 5 min the flask was removed, and after a predetermined period (see below) males were quickly netted and sacrificed by decapitation within seconds following an IACUC approved protocol (#15077) of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Most of these encode the equine homologs of known protein-coding genes described in other species, yet the potential exists to identify novel and perhaps equine-specific gene structures.  A set of 36 transcripts were prioritized for further study by filtering for levels of expression (depth of RNA-seq read coverage), distance from annotated features in the equine genome, the number of putative exons, and patterns of gene expression between tissues.  From these, four were selected for further investigation based on predicted open reading frames of greater than or equal to 50 amino acids and lack of detectable homology to known genes across species.  Sanger sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons from additional equine samples confirmed expression and structural annotation of each transcript.  Functional predictions were made by conserved domain searches.  A single transcript, expressed in the cerebellum, contains a putative kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, suggesting a potential function associated with zinc finger proteins and transcriptional regulation.  Overall levels of conserved synteny and sequence conservation across a 1MB region surrounding each transcript were approximately 73% compared to the human, canine, and bovine genomes; however, the four loci display some areas of low conservation and sequence inversion in regions that immediately flank these previously unannotated equine transcripts.

The phenotype of equine CVID is similar to that of CVID-affected humans who lack B lymphocytes. We have determined that the loss of B lymphocytes is due to a failure of differentiation in the bone marrow of equine CVID patients. Transcriptome sequencing was undertaken to assess the expression of genes and transcription factors known to be essential for B cell differentiation, and simultaneously obtain a comprehensive view of gene expression in the bone marrow. Analysis of bone marrow mRNA expression from CVID horses revealed a significant decrease in E2A (p < 0.05) and a marked decrease in PAX5 (p < 0.01) expression in comparison to healthy horses. E2A and PAX5 are transcription factors essential to successful B cell differentiation, and are indicative of specific B cell stages.

"SRP051087"	"Equus caballus Transcriptome or Gene expression"	"The physiological changes associated with the varying hormonal environment throughout the oestrous cycle have been analysed in several species. These changes are linked to the many functions the uterus needs to fulfil, such as clearing contaminants introduced via breeding and supporting the development of a foetus. The aim of this study was to generate global gene expression profiles for the equine uterus during oestrus and dioestrus. To achieve this, samples were collected from 5 horses, once during oestrus (follicle > 35mm diameter) and once during dioestrus (5 days post ovulation), and analysed using high throughput RNA-Seq technologies. Genes identified as being differentially expressed between the two cycle stages were further investigated using Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. The expression levels of a total of 1577 genes were found to be significantly up-regulated during oestrus while 1864 genes were expressed at significantly higher levels in dioestrus. Most genes up-regulated during oestrus were associated with the extra-cellular matrix, signal interaction and transduction, cell communication or the immune function, whereas genes expressed at higher levels in dioestrus were most commonly associated with metabolic or transport functions. This correlates well with the physiological functions of the uterus - during oestrus it is expected to be preparing for potential infections facilitated by an open cervix and breeding, while the dioestrous uterus needs to be accommodating to a potential conceptus. These results allow for a more complete understanding of the hormonal influence on gene expression in the equine uterus and provide a valuable baseline for further research in equine reproduction, including analyses of changes associated with infection and inflammation."

The aim of this study was to examine this by means of RNA sequencing. Four days after ovulation, the oviduct epithelial cells ipsilateral and contralateral to the ovulation side from five cyclic and five pregnant mares were collected. mRNA was extracted and samples were sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq-2000 sequencer. Data analysis was performed with the CLC Genomics software and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined (p-value = 0.05 and absolute fold change = 2). ClueGO was used for functional interpretation. A total of 26,991 genes was identified and 253 genes were found to be upregulated and 108 to be downregulated in the pregnant ipsilateral oviduct, when compared to the cyclic ipsilateral oviduct. Comparison of the ipsilateral and the contralateral oviduct indicated 164 DEGs in pregnant mares and 77 DEGs in cyclic mares. Functional enrichment analysis only detected differences in the comparison of pregnant and cyclic ipsilateral oviducts and showed that the equine embryo affects the expression of immune response related genes in the oviduct, with marked upregulation of interferon associated genes. This research represents the foundation for further assessment of the role of specific genes in the early embryo-maternal dialogue of the horse. Overall design: mRNA profiles of epithelial cells of equine oviducts ipsilateral and contralateral to the ovulation side of pregnant and cyclic mares four days after ovulation were examined, resulting in four different conditions (pregnant ipsilateral, pregnant contralateral, cyclic ipsilateral and cyclic contralateral, consisting of five biological replicates each."

Methods: Whole transcriptome profiling of blood was performed for  untrained horses and  horses from which samples were collected during at 3 different periods of training procedure (T1-during intense training period - March, T2- before starts - May and T3 -after flat racing season - October). The muscle transcriptome sequencing was performed for 37 blood samples using Illumina HiScan SQ in 75 single-end cycles. The quantifying transcript abundances was made using the RSEM supported by STAR aligner. The raw reads were aligned to the Equus caballus reference genome. Differentially expressed genes in blood tissue were detected by DESeq2. The RNA-seq results were validated using by qPCR. Results: The increase of the number of DEGs between subsequent training periods has been observed and the highest amount of DEGs was detected between untrained horses (T0) and horses at the end of the racing season (T3) - 440. The comparison of transcriptome of T2 vs T3 and T0 vs T3 showed a significant advantage of up-regulated genes during long-term exercise (up-regulation of 266 and 389 DEGs in T3 period compared T2 and T0; respectively). Our results showed that the largest number of identified genes encoded transcription factors, nucleic acid binding proteins and G-protein modulators, which mainly were transcriptional  activated at the last training phase (T3) . Moreover, in the T3 period the identified DEGs represented genes coded for cytoskeletal proteins including actin cytoskeletal proteins and kinases. The most abundant exercise-upregulated genes were involved in pathways important in regulating the cell cycle (PI3K-Akt signaling pathway), cell communication (cAMP-dependent pathway), proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis as well as immunity processes (Jak-STAT signaling pathway). We also observed exercise induced expression of genes related in regulation of actin cytoskeleton, gluconeogenesis (FoxO signaling pathway; Insulin signaling pathway), glycerophospholipid metabolism and calcium signaling. Conclusions: TOur results allow to identify changes in genes expression profile following training schedule in Arabian horses. Based on comparison analysis of blood transcriptomes, several exercise-regulated pathways and genes most affected by exercise were detected. We pinpointed overrepresented molecular pathways and genes essential for exercise adaptive response via maintaining of body homeostasis. The observed transcriptional activation of such gene as LPGAT1, AGPAT5, PIK3CG, GPD2,  FOXN2, FOXO3, ACVR1B and ACVR2A can be a base for further research in order to identify genes potentially associated with race performance in Arabian horses. Such markers will be essential to choice the training type, and could result in differences in racing performance specific to various breeds.

Methods: Whole transcriptomes between three time points of muscle tissue collection were compared: T0 (untrained horses),  T1 (horses after intense gallop phase) and T2 (at the end of the racing season), in total 23 samples.  The biopsy of gluteus medius muscle was performed by using minimally invasive ProMag™ Ultra Automatic Biopsy Instrument with a 2 mm diameter biopsy needle. The total RNA was isolated using by TriReagent and 300ng was used to  cDNA libraries preparation.  The NGS sequencing was performed on HiScan SQ (Illumina). The quantifying transcript abundances was made using the RSEM supported by STAR aligner. The raw reads were aligned to the Equus caballus reference genome. Differentially expressed genes were detected by DESeq2. The RNA-seq results were validated using by qPCR. Results: To detected differentially expressed genes during training preparing to the flat racing, whole transcriptomes between three time points of muscle tissue collection were compared: T0 (untrained horses),  T1 (horses after intense gallop phase) and T2 (at the end of the racing season). We identified 1168 DEGs between T0 vs T1; 1593 between T1 vs T2 and 763 between T2 vs T0. The analysis for all DEGs allow to detect 11 pathways which ale significant over represented between at last two training periods. The numerous group of exercise-regulated DEGs was related with muscle cell structure and signaling ('focal adhesion', 'adherens juntion' and 'PI3-ATK signaling') and included insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R); insulin receptor (INSR); transforming growth factor beta receptors 1 and 2 (TGFBR1; TGFBR2); vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB);  epidermal growth factor (EGF); hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor D (FIGF). Our results showed that in Arabian horses exercise modified the expression of genes belonging to the 'PPAR signaling pathway' (e.g. PPARA; PPARD; PLIN2); 'calcium signaling pathway' (e.g. PLN; PLCD1; TNNC1; TNNC2) as well as pathways associated with metabolism processes - 'oxidative phosphorylation'; 'fatty acid metabolism'; 'glycolysis/gluconeogenesis' and 'citrate cycle'. Conclusions: Our research allowed to identify the group of exercise-regulated genes which was related with muscle cell structure as well as signaling and pinpointed the significant metabolic processes critical for adaptive response during training. We confirmed that in Arabians, the exercise switch energy generation towards fatty acid utilization, enhance glycogen transport and calcium signaling. The sequencing of skeletal muscle transcriptome allowed to propose the panel of new candidate genes (such as SLC16A1; ME3; ACTN3; PPARa; SH3RF2; TPM3; TNNC1; TNNI3; TGFBR1; TGFBR2; FABP3) potentially related with body homeostasis maintenance and race performance in Arabian horse.

"SRP007347"	"Profiling of differential allelic expression in horse, donkey, mule and hinny placental tissue"	"The discovery of genomic imprinting through studies of manipulated mouse embryos indicated that the paternal genome has a major influence on placental development.  However, previous research has not demonstrated paternal bias in imprinted genes.  We applied RNA sequencing to trophoblast tissue from reciprocal hybrids of horse and donkey, where genotypic differences allowed parent-of-origin identification of most expressed genes.  Using this approach, we identified a core group of 15 ancient imprinted genes of which 10 were paternally expressed.  An additional 78 candidate novel imprinted genes identified by RNA-seq also showed paternal bias.  Pyrosequencing was used to confirm the imprinting status of six of the novel genes, including the insulin receptor (INSR), which may play a role in growth regulation with its reciprocally imprinted ligand, histone acetyltransferase (HAT1), the first example of an imprinted gene involved in chromatin modification, and LY6G6C, the first imprinted gene to be identified in the major histocompatibility complex.  The 78 novel candidate imprinted genes displayed parent-of-origin expression bias in placenta but not fetus, and most showed less than 100% silencing of the imprinted allele.  Some displayed variability in imprinting status among individuals.  This results in a unique epigenetic signature for each placenta that contributes to variation in the intrauterine environment and thus presents the opportunity for natural selection to operate on parent-of-origin differential regulation.  Taken together, these features highlight the plasticity of imprinting in mammals and the central importance of the placenta as a target tissue for genomic imprinting.

By doing RNA-seq on these tissues we do a number of things: (a) assess the level of allele specific expression in Medaka (b) test whether there is any imprinting (parent of origin) in fish.

We observed a ~200-base pair (bp) periodic pattern of genetic variation downstream of transcription start sites; the rate of insertions and deletions longer than 1 bp peaked at positions of approximately  200,  400, and  600 bp, whereas the point mutation rate showed corresponding valleys. This ~200-bp periodicity was correlated with the chromatin structure, with nucleosome occupancy minimized at positions 0,  200,  400, and  600 bp.

Results: We have characterized sequence variation and expression properties of this set of TSSs (which we call *Nucleocyclic TSSs*) using germline and somatic cells of three medaka (Oryzias latipes) inbred isolates from different locations. We found nucleocyclic TSSs in medaka to be associated with higher gene expression and characterized by a clear boundary in sequence composition with potentially-nucleosome-destabilizing A/T-enrichment upstream (p<1E-60 ) and nucleosome-accommodating C/G-enrichment downstream (p<1E-40 ) that was highly conserved from an ancestor. A substantial genetic distance between the strains facilitated the in-depth analysis of patterns of fixed mutations, revealing a localization-specific equilibrium between the rates of distinct mutation categories that would serve to maintain the conserved sequence anisotropy around TSSs. Downstream of nucleocyclic TSSs, C to T, T to C, and other mutation rates on the sense strand increased around first nucleosome dyads and decreased around first linkers, which contrasted with genomewide mutational patterns around nucleosomes (p<5%). C to T rates are higher than G to A rates around nucleosome associated with germline nucleocyclic TSS sites (p<5%), potentially due to the asymmetric effect of transcription-coupled repair.

"SRP011081"	"Platypus fibroblast and ovary transcriptomes"	"As a result of sex chromosome differentiation from ancestral autosomes, male mammalian cells only contain one X chromosome. It has long been hypothesized that X-linked gene expression levels have become doubled in males to restore dosage balance between the X and autosomes, and that the resulting X overexpression in females then drove the evolution of X inactivation (XCI). However, this model has never been directly tested and patterns and mechanisms of dosage compensation across different mammals and birds generally remain little understood. We have traced the evolution of dosage compensation using extensive transcriptome data from males and females representing all major mammalian lineages and birds. Our analyses suggest that the X has become globally upregulated in marsupials but probably not in placental mammals, where instead at least a subset of autosomal genes interacting with X-linked were downregulated. Thus, different driving forces may underlie the evolution of XCI and the highly efficient equilibration of X expression levels between the sexes observed for both of these lineages. In the egg-laying monotremes and birds, which have homologous sex chromosome systems, partial upregulation of the X (Z in birds) evolved but is largely restricted to the heterogametic sex, which provides an explanation for the partially sex-biased X (Z) expression and lack of global inactivation mechanisms in these lineages. Our findings suggest that dosage reductions imposed by sex chromosome differentiation events in amniotes were resolved in strikingly different ways.

"SRP042024"	"Gene expression profiling in the endometrium of pregnant mammals"	"A major challenge in biology is to determine how evolutionarily novel characters originate, however, mechanistic explanations for the origin of novelties are almost completely unknown. The evolution of mammalian pregnancy is an excellent system in which to study the origin of novelties because extant mammals preserve major stages in the transition from egg-laying to live-birth. To determine the molecular bases of this transition, we characterized the pregnant/gravid uterine transcriptome from tetrapods, including species in the three major mammalian lineages, and used ancestral transcriptome reconstruction to trace the evolutionary history of uterine gene expression. We show that thousands of genes evolved or lost uterine expression during the origins of mammalian pregnancy, including the loss of genes responsible for the mineralization of the eggshell in the Mammalian and Therian stem-lineages, and the recruitment of genes into uterine expression that mediate maternal-fetal communication and maternal immunotolerance of the fetal allograft in the Therian and Eutherian stem-lineages. Our results indicate that one of the defining mammalian novelties evolved through a step-wise process that dramatically changed uterine gene expression, generating a suite of evolutionary innovations that support prolonged gestations.

"DRP000894"	"Abundant Bidirectional Transcription around Transcription Start Sites in Mammals"	"In mammals, more than 60% of the genome is use for transcription for mRNAs and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). A fraction of ncRNAs have been believed to downregulate the corresponding mRNA expression level in a pre- or post- transcriptional manner by forming RNA-RNA duplex structures.To examine the directional properties of transcription at the whole genome level, we performed directional RNA-seq analysis of mouse brain and heart samples. Our analysis revealed that there is only a small fraction of the genome where both the top and bottom strands are utilized for transcription.A significant fraction of transcription start sites (TSSs) of protein-coding genes contain borders that separate antisense- and sense-biased transcription, suggesting that head-to-head transcription at the TSS is more prevalent than previously thought.The expression of the resultant promoter-associated ncRNAs (pancRNAs) tends to occur together with that of the corresponding mRNA in a coordinated manner. A fraction of genes with tissue-specific pancRNAs show a positive correlation between their pancRNA and mRNA expression, which is in accord with the proposed role for pancRNA in facultative gene activation, whereas genes with constitutive expression lack an association with pancRNA. More than 90% of head-to-head type promoters contain CpG islands. Moreover, CCG and CGG repeats are significantly enriched in the upstream regions and downstream regions, respectively, of TSSs located in head-to-head type promoters. Here, we propose that head-to-head transcription from GC-rich sequences regulates gene expression."	"SRA"	"partial"

Most of these studies, however, estimated gene expression levels using microarray probes designed to hybridize to only a small proportion of each gene. Here we used recently-developed RNA sequencing protocols, which side-step this limitation, to assess intra- and inter-species variation in gene regulatory processes in considerably more detail than was previously possible. Specifically, we used RNAseq to study transcript levels in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques, using liver RNA samples from three males and three females from each species. Our approach allowed us to identify a large number of genes whose expression levels likely evolve under natural selection in primates. These include a subset of genes with conserved sexually dimorphic expression patterns across the three species, which we found to be enriched for genes involved in lipid metabolism. Our data also suggest that while alternative splicing is tightly regulated within and between species, sex-specific and lineage-specific changes in the expression of different splice forms are also frequent. Intriguingly, among genes in which a change in exon usage occurred exclusively in the human lineage, we found an enrichment of genes involved in anatomical structure and morphogenesis, raising the possibility that differences in the regulation of alternative splicing have been an important force in human evolution.

We found the genes with expression changes in autism are significantly overlapped with genes showing human-specific developmental profile. A major pattern of the overlapped genes reflects the aberrant acceleration of synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation followed by premature synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex of autism patients. This pattern involves the same developmental program that controls human-specific extension of cortical synaptogenesis in healthy individuals. Taken together, these findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying autistic phenotype and provide potential targets for clinical intervention.

To comprehensively study the mechanism of marsupial XCI, we profiled parent-of-origin-specific-allele expression, DNA methylation, and histone modifications in opossum fetal brain and extra-embryonic membranes. The majority (152/176) of X-linked genes exhibited paternally imprinted expression with nearly 100% maternal allele expression, whereas 24 loci (14%) escaped inactivation showing varying levels of biallelic expression.

As such, identifying the origins of variation is a fundamental goal of biology. We investigated the link between gene interactions and variation in gene expression among individuals and species, using the mammalian limb as a model system. We first built interaction networks for key genes regulating early (outgrowth; E9.5-11) and late (expansion and elongation; E11-13) limb development in mouse. This resulted in an Early (ESN) and Late (LSN) Stage Network. Computational perturbations of these networks suggest that the ESN is more robust. We then quantified levels of the same key genes among mouse individuals, and found that they vary less at earlier limb stages and that variation in gene expression is heritable. Finally, we quantified variation in gene expression levels among four mammals with divergent limbs (bat, opossum, mouse and pig), and found that levels vary less among species at earlier limb stages. We also found that variation in gene expression levels among individuals and species are correlated for earlier and later limb development. In conclusion, results are consistent with the robustness of the ESN buffering among-individual variation in gene expression levels early in mammalian limb development, and constraining the evolution of early limb development among mammalian species.

The initial exposure caused two behavioral effects at the individual level: an increase in the intensity of aggression toward a second intruder at 30 and 60 minutes, and an increased probability of responding aggressively toward a second intruder that persisted for two hours. The shorter-lived response was associated with one pattern of gene expression in the mushroom bodies, highlighted by genes related to cytoskeleton remodeling. The longer-lived response was associated with a different pattern; highlighted by genes related to hormones, stress response and transcription factors. Histone profiling revealed few changes in chromatin accessibility in response to social challenge; most differentially expressed genes were *ready* to be activated.

"SRP045680"	"Astyanax mexicanus - Developmental Gene Expression"	"Astyanax mexicanus, commonly know as the blind Mexican cavefish, is an excellent system to investigate the genetic basis for traits evolving as a consequence of natural environmental pressures. This species includes multiple cave-dwelling populations that have colonized the dark, subterranean environment, and repeatedly evolved a suite of troglomorphic traits, including eye degeneration, loss of pigmentation, alterations in behavior, increased number of taste buds, and an enhanced lateral line system. To investigate the genetic changes associated with cave colonization, we have utilized RNA-seq technologies to compare gene expression variation between surface- and cave-dwelling forms of Astyanax mexicanus. This approach includes a dynamic comparison across four critical stages of early development wherein many troglomorphic-specific traits appear. These analyses dramatically enhance our understanding of phenotypic evolution in the wild, and offer insight to analogous human diseases, including retinal degeneration, pigmentation disorders, craniofacial abnormalities and altered sleep/activity patterns."

Despite their wide distribution, pike populations have low levels of polymorphism and divergence, indicative of a recent common ancestor. Pike often function as sentinel species to monitor pollutants in northern waters. Mitochondrial studies have shown that Escosiformes is the closest living order to Salmoniformes. Esociformes, an old lineage with fossils dating back to 70MYA, contains 10 species (pike, muskellunge and mudminnows) of which most literature concerns pike. The genome size for pike is 1.1pg and its karyotype is 2N=50 NF=50, similar to ancestral karyotypes of many teleosts (2N=48-50, FN=48-50). This compares to the much larger Atlantic salmon karyotype of 2N=56-60, NF=74 and genome size =3.1pg.

There are still many aspects of host-parasite interaction and disease pathogenesis that are yet to be elucidated, and to date, no analysis of the transcriptomic changes induced by E. scophthalmi in turbot organs has been conducted. In this study, RNA-seq technology was applied to head kidney, spleen and pyloric caeca of severely infected turbot with the aim of furthering our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms and turbot immune response against enteromyxosis. Results: A huge amount of information was generated with more than 23,000 identified genes in the three organs, amongst which 4,762 were differently expressed (DE) between infected and control fish. Associate gene functions were studied based on gene ontology terms and available literature, and the most interesting DE genes were classified into five categories: 1) immune and defence response; 2) apoptosis and cell proliferation; 3) iron metabolism and erythropoiesis; 4) cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix and 5) metabolism and digestive function. The analysis of down-regulated genes of the first category revealed evidences of a connexion failure between innate and adaptive immune response, especially represented by a high number of DE interferon-related genes in the three organs. Furthermore, we found an intense activation of local immune response at intestinal level that appeared exacerbated, whereas in kidney and spleen genes involved in adaptive immune response were mainly down-regulated. The apoptotic machinery was only clearly activated in pyloric caeca, while kidney and spleen showed a marked depression of genes related to erythropoiesis, probably related to disorders in iron homeostasis. The genetic signature of the causes and consequences of cachexia was also demonstrated by the down-regulation of the genes encoding structural proteins and those involved in the digestive metabolism. Conclusions: This transcriptomic study has enabled us to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of enteromyxosis and identify a large number of DE target genes that bring us closer to the development of strategies designed to effectively combat this pathogen. Overall design: Four samples per organ (kidney, spleen and pyloric caeca) were sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000 as 100bp paired-end reads. For each organ, three samples were taken from Enteromyxum severely infected turbot and the remaining one was a pool of three control turbot."	"SRA"	"partial"	"GSE63911, PRJNA269386"	"NA"

Silver foxes have been selectively bred for tame and aggressive behaviors for over 50 years at the Institute for Cytology and Genetics in Novosibirsk, Russia. To further understand the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms underlying tame and aggressive behavioral phenotypes segregating in selected strains of the silver fox, we quantified genome-wide gene expression levels using RNA-seq in two selected brain tissues, right prefrontal cortex and basal forebrain, from 12 aggressive and 12 tame individuals. Expression analysis reveals 146 differentially expressed genes in prefrontal cortex between tame and aggressive individuals at a 5% FDR, and 33 hits were found in basal forebrain. These candidates include genes in key pathways known to be critical to neurological processing, such as serotonin and glutamate receptor pathways. The data relate in interesting ways to neurological and pharmacological effects that are actively being studied to understand human aggression. In addition, we identified 31,000 high quality exonic SNPs, 295 of which show significant allele frequency differences between tame and aggressive individuals at an adjust P-value < 0.05 level from gene dropping simulation based on the entire pedigrees. A non-synonymous change in a glutamate receptor, GRM3, is among these significant SNPs, indicating that expression and allele-frequency changes are hitting the same pathways. These changes in expression level and allele frequency might be the direct response to the artificial selection and will help understand the genetic basis of mammalian domestication process.

However, the changes in expression of genes that drive these processes remain incompletely characterised. RNA-seq is the new gold standard for whole transcriptome analysis but so far there are no reports of its application to analysis of differential gene expression in cattle liver. We used RNA-seq to study differences in expression profiles of hepatic genes and their associated pathways in individual cattle in either mild negative energy balance (MNEB) or severe negative energy balance (SNEB). NEB is an imbalance between energy intake and energy requirements for lactation and body maintenance. This aberrant metabolic state affects high-yielding dairy cows after calving and is of considerable economic importance because of its negative impact on fertility and health in dairy herds. Analysis of changes in hepatic gene expression in SNEB animals will increase our understanding of NEB and contribute to the development of strategies to circumvent it.     Results: RNA-seq analysis was carried out on total RNA from liver from early post partum Holstein Friesian cows in MNEB (n=5) and SNEB (n=6). 12,833 genes were deemed to be expressed (>4 reads per gene per animal), 413 of which were shown to be statistically significantly differentially expressed (SDE) at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1% and 200 of which were SDE (FDR of 0.1%) with a =2-fold change between MNEB and SNEB animals. GOseq/KEGG pathway analysis showed that SDE genes with =2- fold change were associated (P <0.05) with 9 KEGG pathways. Seven of these pathways were related to fatty acid metabolism and unexpectedly included â€˜Steroid hormone biosynthesisâ€™, a process which mainly occurs in the reproductive organs rather than the liver.    Conclusions: RNA-seq analysis showed that the major changes at the level of transcription in the liver of SNEB cows were related to fat metabolism. ''Steroid hormone biosynthesis'', a process that normally occurs in reproductive tissue, was significantly associated with changes in gene expression in the liver of SNEB cows. Changes in gene expression were found in this pathway that have not been previously been identified in SNEB cows.

"SRP014561"	"Comparative transcriptome analysis of various adipose depots in Hanwoo"	"*Background: Adipocytes mainly function as energy storage and endocrine cells.  The amount and distribution of fat are important factor that influence the meat quality in the beef industry.  Fat depot can be found around internal organ (ometal), beneath the skin (subcutaneous), and between muscles (intramuscular).  Different adipose depot showed the biological and genetic difference depending on their location.  This inter-depot variation might be influenced by the inherent genetic programing for development of adipose depots.  In this study, we used RNA-seq data to investigate the difference in transcriptome of various adipose depots in Hanwoo. *Results: Using RNA-seq, we identified 5797, 2156, and 5455 DEGs in the comparison between OI, OS, and IS respectively (FDR<0.01) and found 853, 48, and 979 DEGs specific to subcutaneous, intramuscular and omental fat respectively.  DEGs in intramuscular fat were highly enriched the metabolism related pathways compared to other fat depots. DEGs specific to the omental fat is significantly enriched in PPAR signaling pathway and cell-junction related pathway.  In subcutaneous fat, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction with chemokines (CXC and CC subfamily) was the most significantly enriched the pathways.  Interestingly, melanogenesis pathway was associated with the subcutaneous depot.  Even though the adipose tissues shared the same pathways for adipocyte differentiation, the regulation of genes were different based on the depot. *Conclusions: We comparatively analyzed the transcripome profile from different adipose tissues using NGS and identified DEGs between adipose depot and specific to depot in Hanwoo animals.  The functional annotation analysis of DEGs found that transcriptome profile difference in various adipose tissue of intramuscular, subcutaneous, and ometal fat.

"SRP026485"	"RNA-seq analysis of differential gene expression in muscle from angus beef steers undergoing diet restriction and compensatory growth"	"The objective of this study was to examine changes in muscle gene expression of growing steers during a period of dietary energy restriction followed by a period of realimentation. Crossbred Aberdeen Angus x Holstein Friesian (n = 24) steers were assigned to one of two feeding treatments. Over a 99 d period, 1 group (n=12) was offered a high energy control diet consisting of concentrates ad libitum and 7 kg of grass silage per head daily. The second group (n=12) was offered an energy restricted diet consisting of grass silage ad libitum plus 0.5 kg of concentrate per head per day. From the end of the differential feeding period (99 d), both groups of animals were offered a total mixed ration (grass silage:concentrate ratio of 80:20). This period, which lasted 200 d, was known as the realimentation period. All animals were slaughtered on d 299 of the study. Muscle biopsies were collected at 2 time points (end of the differential feeding period (d 99) and during the realimentation period (d131). RNA was extracted and muscle gene expression was examined using RNA-seq technology and bioinformatic analysis. During the differential feeding period, 17 over-represented pathways were identified, including the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor signalling, glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis and metabolic pathways controlling the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins which indicate reduced energy intake and fat tissue accumulation occurring in muscle tissue during the restriction phase. During the realimentation period, 164 differentially expressed genes were annotated to 9 over-represented pathways including starch and sucrose metabolism, carbohydrate digestion and absorption and TGF-ÃŸ signalling pathway. It is hypothesised that the signalling effects of the TGF-ÃŸ pathway were reduced thereby promoting accelerated cell growth and proliferation in muscle tissue of animals experiencing compensatory growth. This information can be exploited in genomic breeding programmes to assist selection of cattle with a greater ability to compensate following a period dietary restriction. Overall design: 24 muscle RNA samples were analysed in total. 6 samples were from muscle biopsies collected at the end of a period of dietary restriction (d99) and 6 samples were from muscle biopsies collected at the peak of compensatory growth (d131). In addition, RNA was also analysed from 6 samples collected from animals fed ad libitum at each of these two timepoints."	"SRA"	"total"	"GSE48481"	"NA"

Herein, we characterized the transcriptome of five reproductive tissues (i.e. hypothalamus, pituitary gland, ovary, uterus, and endometrium) as well as tissues known to be relevant to growth and metabolism needed for cattle to achieve puberty (i.e., longissimus dorsi muscle, fat, and liver). These tissues were collected from pre (PRE)- and post (POST)-pubertal Brangus (3/8 Brahman; Bos indicus x 5/8 Angus; Bos taurus) heifers derived from a population of cattle used to identify QTL associated with fertility traits. In order to exploit the power of complementary omics analyses, PRE and POST puberty co-expression gene networks were constructed by combining the results from RNA-Seq, GWAS, and bovine transcription factors. RNA-Seq of 8 tissues among PRE and POST Brangus heifers revealed 1515 differentiallyexpressed and 943 tissue-specific genes within the 17,832 genes confirmed by metrics of RNA-Seq analysis. Combining the results from RNA-Seq and GWAS indentified a total of 25 QTL associated to heifer fertility. The hypothalamus experienced the most notable up-regulation of genes via puberty. Complementary omics procedures revealed 2,450 co-expressed genes across the 8 tissues relative to puberty. The PRE network had 372,861 connections whereas the POST network had 328,357 connections. A sub-network from this process revealed key transcriptional regulators (i.e., PITX2, FOXA1, TSG1D1, DACH2, LHX4, PROP1 and SIX6).  Results from multiples sources of omics data will facilitate the design of breeding strategies to improve fertility in Bos indicus-influenced composite cattle. Overall design: Sixty-one samples from PRE and POST pubertal composite beef heifers were analyzed with RNA-Seq.

The highly repetitive and degenerative nature of the Y chromosome impedes genomic and transcriptomic characterization. Although the Y chromosome sequence is available for the human, chimpanzee, and macaque, little is known about the annotation and transcriptome of nonprimate MSY. Here, we investigated the transcriptome of the MSY in cattle by direct testis cDNA selection and RNA-seq approaches. The bovine MSY differs radically from the primate Y chromosomes with respect to its structure, gene content, and density. Among the 28 protein-coding genes/families identified on the bovine MSY (12 single- and 16 multicopy genes), 16 are bovid specific. The 1,274 genes identified in this study made the bovine MSY gene density the highest in the genome; in comparison, primate MSYs have only 31-78 genes. Our results, along with the highly transcriptional activities observed from these Y-chromosome genes and 375 additional noncoding RNAs, challenge the widely accepted hypothesis that the MSY is gene poor and transcriptionally inert. The bovine MSY genes are predominantly expressed and are differentially regulated during the testicular development. Synonymous substitution rate analyses of the multicopy MSY genes indicated that two major periods of expansion occurred during the Miocene and Pliocene, contributing to the adaptive radiation of bovids.

Here we generated transcriptome data of single oocytes and the surrounding cumulus cells from antral follicles, and developed an analytical framework to unveil their inter-cellular communication. We identified hundreds of ligand-receptors pairs that can transduce paracrine signaling between oocyte and cumulus. Several of the ligand-coding genes expressed in oocytes and cumulus cells are also functionally associated with regulation of transcription. Ligand-coding genes expressed in oocytes or cumulus showed distinct enrichment for biological functions that are likely associated with a coordinated formation of the transzonal projections from the cumulus that reach the oocyteâ€™s membrane. Finally, there were thousands of gene pairs with non-trivial linear co-expression pattern between oocytes and cumulus cells. Our analyses revealed a complex and functional regulatory circuit between the oocyte and surrounding cumulus cells.

Samples were collected from Chinese Qinchuan fetal bovine, heifers, bulls, and steers. We unambiguously detected a substantial number of differently expressed genes (DEGs), novel transcript units (NTUs), and splicing variants.The expressional profile of adipose tissue changed considerably from fetuses to adults, whereas smaller differences were detected between the adipose tissues of adult cows (ATACs). As an endocrine organ, DEGs related to inflammatory and immune process were significantly enriched in the ATACs. These genes may play some roles in different regulation mechanisms of adipose tissue in different genders. In addition, adipose tissue abundantly expressed genes concerning the functions of the mitochondria and the ribosomes. These support the adipose tissue as an extremely active tissue for energy and protein metabolism besides the storage of surplus fuel. In this study, about two-thirds of the NTUs did not have coding ability. Both the NTUs with and without coding ability were enriched from 300bp to 1,500bp. The main difference in the number of the two types of NTUs was also concentrated in this range.  In total, about 18.2% of the genes in adipose tissues were alternatively spliced, and half of them were specially expressed in different patterns. Combined with previous studies, we concluded that alternatively splicing events occur variously in different tissues or different patterns of adipose tissue. Taken together, our study provided complete datasets involving the spatial and temporal transcriptome of adipose tissue which suggested the complexity of adipose tissue and our study will provide essential information for further research.

Calving interval is a trait used to measure reproductive efficiency. Here we used a novel lactating Holstein cow model with genetic and phenotypic divergence in calving interval. Cows had similar genetic merit for milk production traits, but either very good genetic merit for fertility (Fert+; n = 7) or very poor genetic merit for fertility (Fert-; n = 6). We sequenced the transcriptome of endometrial biopsies collected on day 7 of the estrous cycle, a crucial stage for establishment of pregnancy. Significant differential expression (FDR adjusted p < 0.1) of 403 genes was found between the  Fert+ and Fert- animals. A standard over-representation analysis resulted in 12 lowly populated canonical pathways; however a novel in-depth analysis revealed a core of eighteen genes both differentially expressed and highly abundant. Almost all of these genes were related to actin-related and cytoskeletal components of the endometrium; fundamental cell-structure differences existed between  Fert+ and Fert- phenotypes. We also present results indicating inflammation-related genes are down-regulated, and that multiple ion transporters and gated-voltage channels were up-regulated, in Fert+ cows. These three topics are discussed in terms of the uterus and in the context of fertility during early embryo development. Transcriptomic data analysis is complex; we use a method that filters those genes that may be of greatest importance to the tissue at the timepoint of sampling. Our findings support the utility of this approach, as well as highlighting clear physiological differences in our animal model.

"SRP045641"	"RNA-seq analysis of trait-associated genes (TAGs) in somatic cells from Holstein milk"	"Background : Although the chemical, physical, and nutritional properties of bovine milk have been extensively studied, few studies have attempted to characterize the milk synthesizing genes associated with milk yielding traits. In addition, no previous attempts have been made to detect quantitative traits such as milk production related traits, associated genes on RNA-seq experiment with several biological replicates. Research in this field is necessary as bovine milk is a primary source of nutrition for humans. Results : We investigated advantages of using linear models with continuous response variables over converted group variables in a Holsteinsâ€™ milk. Suggested methods were more suitable in detection of significant genes in our analysis; the proportion of false discoveries to total significant genes was observed to be much lower compared to the precedent approaches we employed. These were observed through mock comparison studies and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Conclusion : Several milk production related genes and pathways were identified from the suggested methods. Given the current trend in RNA-seq pricing, we expect our methods to be successfully applied in various RNA-seq studies with numerous biological replicates that handle continuous response traits.

Complex systemic and local processes involving gluconeogenesis, energy balance, utilisation of body reserves, insulin resistance and involution of the uterus can have an effect on animal health and farm profitability. Here we used an established Holstein cow model of fertility that displayed genetic and phenotypic divergence in calving interval, a trait used to define reproductive performance using a national breeding index in Ireland. Cows had similar genetic merit for milk production traits, but either very good genetic merit for fertility (â€˜Fert+â€™; n = 8) or very poor genetic merit for fertility (â€˜Fert-â€˜; n = 8). We investigated three distinct time-points, late pregnancy, early lactation and mid lactation (-18, 1 and 147 days on average with day 0 being birth), using RNA sequencing from both liver and muscle tissue biopsies and conducting a differential expression (DE) analysis. We found 807 and 815 unique genes to be DE in at least one time-point in liver and muscle respectively, of which 79% and 83% were only found in a single time-point; 40 and 41 genes were found DE at every time-point indicating possibly systemic or chronic dysregulation. Functional annotation resulted in evidence for two major physiological processes: immune and inflammation, and metabolic, lipid and carbohydrate-binding. These processes indicate areas of previous interest as well as specific systems that appear differentially regulated, and point towards interesting avenues of further research in a broad and complex field.

"SRP050127"	"Ruminal transcriptomic analysis of grass-fed and grain-fed Angus beef cattle"	"Beef represents a major diet component and one of the major sources of protein in human. The beef industry in the United States is currently undergoing changes and is facing increased demands especially for natural grass-fed beef. The grass-fed beef obtained their nutrients directly from pastures, which contained limited assimilable energy but abundant amount of fiber. On the contrary, the grain-fed steers received a grain-based regime that served as an efficient source of high-digestible energy. Lately, ruminant animals have been accused to be a substantial contributor for the green house effect. Therefore, the concerns from environmentalism, animal welfare and public health have driven consumers to choose grass-fed beef. Rumen is one of the key workshops to digest forage constituting a critical step to supply enough nutrients for animalsâ€™ growth and production. We hypothesize that rumen may function differently in grass- and grain-fed regimes. The objective of this study was to find the differentially expressed genes in the ruminal wall of grass-fed and grain-fed steers, and then explore the potential biopathways. In this study, the RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) method was used to measure the gene expression level in the ruminal wall. The total number of reads per sample ranged from 24,697,373 to 36,714,704. The analysis detected 342 differentially expressed genes between ruminal wall samples of animals raised under different regimens. The Fisherâ€™s exact test performed in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software found 16 significant molecular networks. Additionally, 13 significantly enriched pathways were identified, most of which were related to cell development and biosynthesis. Our analysis demonstrated that most of the pathways enriched with the differentially expressed genes were related to cell development and biosynthesis. Our results provided valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms resulting in the phenotype difference between grass-fed and grain-fed cattle. Overall design: Ruminal wall samples from two randomly chosen animals per group were obtained, totaling four samples. The animals were born, raised and maintained at the Wye Angus farm. This herd, which has been closed for almost 75 years and yielded genetically similar progenies, constitutes an excellent resource to perform transcriptomic analysis. The genetic resemblance among individuals permits us to better control the cause of variation between experimental clusters and individuals. The randomly chosen pairs of animals were part of larger sets of steers that received a particular treatment. All animals received the same diet until weaning. The grain group received conventional diet consisting of corn silage, shelled corn, soy bean and trace minerals. The grass fed steers consumed normally grazed alfalfa; during wintertime, bailage was utilized. The alfalfa has been harvested from land without any fertilizers, pesticides or other chemicals. The steers ate no animal, agricultural or industrial byproducts and never receive any type of grain. Then, the calves were randomly assigned to one diet and exclusively received that regimen until termination. Grainâ€“fed animals reached the market weight around the age of 14 month-old, however, grass-fed steers required approximately 200 additional days to achieve the same weight. Immediately after termination at the Old Line Custom Meat Company (Baltimore, MD) a small piece of ruminal wall was excised, cleaned and preserved at -80Â°C for posterior processing."

Purebred Holstein Friesian bulls (n=20) were assigned to one of two feeding treatments (i) restricted feed allowance for 125 days (n=10) followed by ad libitum access to feed for a further 55 days or (ii) a control group with ad libitum access to feed through out the 180 days trial (n=10).  The first 125 days of the trial were denoted as Peirod 1, during which treatment groups were fed differentially. The subsequent 55 days, denoted as Period 2 during which all bulls were fed ad libitum. All bulls received the same diet of 70% concentrate 30% grass silage through out the experimental trial,with the amount of feed provided different dependnet on each treatment group. At the end of each period, 10 animals from each treatment group (10, restricted fed and 10 ad libitum fed) were slaughtered and hepatic tissue collected within thirty minutes of slaughter. RNA was extracted and hepatic gene expression was examined using RNAseq technology and bioinformatic analysis. During the differential feeding period, over-represented pathways including amino acid and lipid metabolism, protein synthesis and cell cycle/proliferation were identified, which indicate alterations in metabolic and growth rate in the liver during dietary restriction . During the realimentation period, pathways involved in cell cycle and cell growth as well as protein synthesis were over-represented, with the direction of fold changes opposite to that of these pathways in Period 1. This information can be exploited in genomic breeding programmes to assist selection of cattle with a greater ability to compensate following a period dietary restriction. Overall design: 40 liver RNA samples were analysed in total. 10 samples were from liver biopsies collected at the end of a period of dietary restriction (d 125) and 10 samples were from liver biopsis collected after 55 days of compensatory growth (d 55 of re-alimentation).

In addition to this, molecular mechanisms also very different each other. Furthermore, it is important to employ a variety of tissues in RNA-seq experiment because recent studies imply gene expression pattern are highly tissue specific. Although previous related studies discovered numerous sexually dimorphic mechanism in mammal species, but still, many mechanisms are undiscovered in case of non-model organisms. One of the representative mammal organism is a cattle which is less researched about sexual dimorphism. For investigate bovine sexual dimorphism, we generated two-way factorial designed 40 samples RNA-seq data composed with two factors such as gender and tissues. Two statistical approaches are employed for identifying bovine sexually dimorphic genes using such two-way factorial designed RNA-seq data. As a result, we observed that detected sexually dimorphic genes exhibited strong tissue specific pattern, but fat tissue showed relatively small tissue specificity than the others. In addition, we observed that sex-related genes are shared in two mammal species such as cattle and rat through qRT-PCR experiments. Finally, we investigated pros and cons of two statistical approaches for complex structured RNA-seq analysis.

However, limit studies on the overall expression status of lncRNAs during muscle development have been conducted. To explore the potential functions of lncRNAs in cattle muscle development, we employed Ribo-Zero-Seq to systematically identify lncRNAs expressed in embryonic (90 day), neonatal (3-day-old) and adult (24-month-old) longissimus muscle (LM) of Qinchuan steers. We finally defined 7692 high-confidence lncRNAs. Further data analyses showed that a total of 401 lncRNAs were differentially expressed among three tested samples, including H19, linc-MD1 and TCONS_00154844. Interestingly, the chromosomal location of linc-MD1 and TCONS_00154844 is overlapped with miR-206/miR-133b or miR-1-2/miR-133a-2 cluster, respectively. miR-1, miR-133 and miR-206 are the most extensively studied miRNAs involved in myogenesis. The genomic close positional relationship between linc-MD1 and miR-206/miR-133b, TCONS_00154844 and miR-1-2/miR-133a-2 strongly indicated that these lncRNAs may play crucial roles in muscle development. GO annotation and KEGG analyses demonstrated that the lncRNAs-targeted mRNAs were related to myogenic differentiation, including metabolic pathways, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.

Besides energy, these two types of diet differ in a large number of nutritional components. Additionally, animals maintained on rich-energy regimen are more likely to develop metabolic disorders and infectious diseases than pasture raised individuals. Thus, we hypothesize that spleenâ€“the main immune organâ€“may function differently under disparate regimes. The objective of this study was to find the differentially expressed genes in the spleen of grass-fed and grain-fed steers, and furtherly explore the potential involved biopathways. Through RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), we detected 123 differentially expressed genes. Based on these genes, we performed an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and identified 9 significant molecular networks and 13 enriched biological pathways. Two of the pathways, Nur77 signaling in T lymphocytes and calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis which are immune related, contain a pair of genes HLA-DRA and NR4A1 with dramatically altered expression level. Collectively, our results provided valuable insights into understanding the molecular mechanism of spleen under varied feeding regimens.

With an increment demand for beef, the industry is currently undergoing changes towards natural produced beef. Consumers not only concern about product quality, but also for the well-being of animals. Therefore, the consumption of grass-fed meat is continuously growing. However, the nutritional true differences between feeding systems are still unclear. The aim of this study was to examine latissimus dorsi muscle quality and animal welfare by transcriptome and metabolome profiles, and to identify biological pathways related to the differences between grass- and grain-fed Angus steers. By RNA-Seq analysis of latissimus dorsi muscle, we have recognized 241 differentially expressed genes (FDR < 0.1). The metabolome examination of muscle and blood revealed 163 and 179 altered compounds in each tissue (P-value < 0.05), respectively.  Accordingly, alterations in glucose metabolism, divergences in free fatty acids and carnitine conjugated lipid levels, and altered ÃŸ-oxidation, have been observed. In summary, this study demonstrates a unique transcriptomic and metabolic signature in the muscle of grain and grass finished cattle. Results support the accumulation of anti-inflammatory n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in grass finished cattle, while higher levels of n6 PUFAs in grain finished animals may promote inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, grass-fed animals produce tender beef with lower total fat and higher omega3/omega6 ratio than grain fed animals, which could potentially benefit consumer health. Finally, blood cortisol levels strongly indicate that grass fed animals experience less stress than the grass fed individuals Overall design: The steers came from a closed Wye Angus herd with very similar genetics. The grass-fed group was comprised of steers that received alfalfa and orchard grass hay, clover and orchard grass pasture, or orchard grass and alfalfa pasture. The grass-fed individuals consumed grazed alfalfa upon availability and bales during winter and were not exposed to any corn, any form of grain or feed by-products.

In Experiment 2, heifers were divided into cyclic (non-bred, n = 6) or pregnant (multiple embryo transfer, n = 10) groups. In vitro-produced presumptive zygotes were transferred endoscopically to the ipsilateral oviduct on Day 1.5 post estrus (n = 50 zygotes per heifer). Heifers were slaughtered on Day 3 and oviductal isthmus epithelial cells were recovered for RNA sequencing. Microarray analysis in Experiment 1 failed to detect any difference in the transcriptome of the oviductal isthmus induced by the presence of a single embryo. In Experiment 2, following multiple embryo transfer, RNA sequencing revealed 278 differentially expressed genes of which 123 were up- and 155 were down-regulated in pregnant heifers. Most of the down-regulated genes were related to immune function.

The calves were gradually weaned over 14 days (day (d) -13 to d 0) and mRNA transcription was examined one day before gradual weaning was initiated (d -14), one day after weaning (d 1) and 8 days after weaning (d 8). RNA-seq analysis was carried out on RNA extracted from whole blood. Gradual weaning had no effect on gene expression (P>0.05).There were 550 differentially expressed genes at a false discovery rate of 10% and with a =1.5-fold change, between Holstein-Friesian and Jersey  calves on d -14, 490 on d 1, and 411 on d 8. GOseq/KEGG pathway analysis showed that the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway and the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway were over-represented between breeds on all days (P<0.01; Q=0.1). These results demonstrate that the gradual weaning practiced here does not compromise the welfare of artificially-reared dairy calves, evidenced by the lack of expression changes in any genes in response to gradual weaning. These data also suggest differences in cell signalling and immune responses between breeds. Overall design: Eight Holstein-Friesian and eight Jersey bull calves were group housed indoors and individually fed milk replacer and concentrate using an automatic feeder. Calves were gradually weaned by reducing milk-replacer from 6 litres to 0 litres over 14 days (d) (d -13 to d 0). Calves were blood sampled on d -14, 1, and 8, relative to weaning (d 0).

However, DNA methylation in the cattle genome is not well understood. Here we presented the first single-base-resolution maps of DNA methylation in 10 diversely somatic tissues harvested from the sequenced Hereford cow L1 Dominette 01449 and her relatives using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS). In total, we observed 1,868,049 high accuracy cytosines that located in the CG enriched regions. Similar to the methylation patterning in other species, the CG context was predominant methylated. Widespread differences were identified between the methylation patterns of CG and non-CG contexts. They were distributed differentially among the genomic features, including the genic regions, CpG islands, and repetitive sequences. Autocorrelation analysis among adjacent residues illustrated that methylation level of CGs were highly correlated in a region. In contrast, weak or no correlation was found among non-CGs or between CGs and non-CGs. The distinct distribution and low correlation of CG and non-CG methylation suggested that non-CG methylation may be independent from CG methylation and may be mediated by different mechanisms. We also detected 798 tissue-specific differentially methylated cytosines (tDMC) and 131 tissue-specific differentially methylated CpG islands. Combined analysis with the RNA-seq data, we discovered several non-CGs in tDMCs also highly correlated with gene expression, which implied the potential function of non-CG methylation in somatic cells in addition to pluripotent cells. In summary, we showed that non-CGs exist in bovine tissues and some of them were correlated with tissue-specific functions. This study provided essential information for the cytosine methylation patterning in bovine somatic tissues. Overall design: We applied RNA_seq for 8 different tissues to detect the effects of methylation on gene expression."	"SRA"	"total"	"GSE86323"

In this study the differences in biological functions and pathways of three crossbreds including 50 and 75 percent Holstein were compared with their purebred parents, Holstein and Taleshi (an indigenous breed) cattle. Results: Five populations and their ten comparisons were studied by bioinformatics tools for transcriptome analysis. We pooled blood RNA of at least 8 animals of each population prior to RNA sequencing. The obtained results showed that total expressed transcripts in all populations were 72,812 with 22,627 annotated genes. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that the genetics information processing and metabolism were the most highly-impacted pathways. Among all significantly enriched pathways, eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2 signaling had the highest activation z-score (5.3) in crossbred compared to purebred cattle. The majority of upstream regulators of genes including transcription regulators and cytokines were differentially expressed among populations in which their activation z-score in purebred was more than crossbred cattle. Conclusions: Crossing of Holstein with Taleshi breed resulted in higher activity of pathways related to genetic information processing and lower activity of pathways related to immunity and inflammatory responses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where the differences in pathways and functions were studied using high throughput sequencing of blood in a cattle crossbreeding program. The analysis revealed that the most important differences between studied genotypes, especially between purebred and crossbred cattle, were related to immune functions and metabolism. Overall design: the blood transcriptome of five cattle populations including two purebreds and the three crossbreds of them.

Therefore, a cattle muscle transcriptome analysis was performed to compare gene expression profiles between embryonic stage and adult stage. Results: Total RNAs from the Qinchuan cattle skeletal muscle at fetal and adult stages were used to construct libraries for Illumina next-generation sequencing using Ribo-Zero RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) method. We found a total of 19,695 genes were expressed in the embryo and adult, and 3,299 and 433 genes were present only in the embryo and adult, respectively. Over 5,000 unigenes were significantly different (P < 0.05) when comparing fetal and adult patterns. We further characterized GosB, which was abundant in skeletal muscle, as the candidate gene to explore its role in cattle development. GosB increased the number of C2C12 myoblasts in S phase, and decreased the proportion of cells in G0/G1 phase. GosB promoted proliferation and protect the C2C12 cells from apoptosis via regulating Bcl-2 expression and controlling the intracellular calcium concentration. Conclusions: Modulation of GosB expression in muscle tissue may emerge as potent tool to control myoblast number in the cattle.

Holstein Friesian bulls (n=38) were assigned to one of two groups: restricted feed allowance (RES; n=19) for 125 days (Period 1) followed by ad libitum access to feed for 55 days (Period 2) or (ii) ad libitum access to feed throughout (ADLIB; n=19).  All bulls received the same diet of 70% concentrate 30% grass silage through out the experimental trial,with the amount of feed provided different dependent on each treatment group. At the end of Period 1, 9 animals from each treatment group were slaughtered, with 10 animals from each treatment slaughtered at the end of Period 2. Rumen epithelium was collected from all animals within thirty minutes of slaughter. RNA was extracted and rumen epithelium gene expression was examined using RNAseq technology on all samles collected (end of Period 1: 9 samples each from ADLIB and RES groups; end of Period 2: 10 samples each from ADLIB and RES groups). Genes identified as differentially expressed in response to both dietary restriction and subsequent compensatory growth included those involved in processes such as cellular interactions and transport, protein folding and gene expression, as well as immune response. This information can be exploited in genomic breeding programmes to assist selection of cattle with a greater ability to compensate following a period dietary restriction. Overall design: 38 rumen epithelium RNA samples were analyzed in total. Purebred Holstein Friesian bulls were assigned to one of two feeding treatments (i) restricted feed allowance for 125 days (n=9) followed by ad libitum access to feed for a further 55 days (n=10) or (ii) a control group with ad libitum access to feed through out the 180 days trial (n=19).

Aberrant DNA methylation has been linked to many of these diseases and is associated with gene expression; however, the functional similarities and differences between porcine and human DNA methylation patterns are largely unknown. DNA and RNA was isolated from eight tissue samples (fat, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, muscle, and spleen) from the adult female Duroc utilized for the pig genome sequencing project. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and RNA-seq were performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000. RRBS reads were aligned using BSseeker2, and only sites with a minimum depth of 10 reads were used for methylation analysis. RNA-seq reads were aligned using Tophat, and expression analysis was performed using Cufflinks. In addition, SNP calling was performed using GATK for targeted control and whole genome sequencing reads for CpG site validation and allelic expression analysis, respectively. These results provide transcriptional and DNA methylation datasets for the biomedical community that are directly relatable to current genomic resources. In addition, the correlation between TSS CpG density and expression suggests increased mutation rates at CpG sites play a significant role in adaptive evolution by reducing CpG density at TSS over time, resulting in higher methylation levels in these regions and more permanent changes to lower gene expression. This is proposed to occur predominantly through deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymidine, resulting in the replacement of CpG with TpG sites in these regions, as indicated by the increased TSS TpG density observed in non-expressed genes, resulting in a negative correlation between expression and TSS TpG density. This study provides baseline methylation and gene transcription profiles for a healthy adult pig, reports similar patterns to those observed in humans, and supports future porcine studies related to human disease and development. Additionally, the observed reduced CpG and increased TpG density at TSS of lowly expressed genes suggests DNA methylation plays a significant role in adaptive evolution through more permanent changes to lower gene expression."

Differences in shear stress can have profound effects on endothelial and blood vessel biology. Endothelial cells (ECs), termed endocardial ECs, line the heart chambers and are exposed to complex shear stress patterns. While it has been demonstrated that shear stress is important for heart development, little has been shown on the role of shear stress on adult ECs. 4D-MRI studies demonstrate regional differences in blood residence time. We sought to determine the effect of regional differences in endocardial shear stress on the endocardial transcriptome using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 3 different regions (apex, mid-ventricle, outflow tract) from 8 adult pigs, for a total of 24 RNA-seq assays."

"Boar taint described as an offensive odor that is released while cooking pork. Androstenone, a steroid mainly synthesized in testis and metabolized in liver is one of the major causes of boar taint. The aim of the present study was to investigate transcriptome differences in boar testis and liver tissues with divergent androstenone levels using RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq). For this purpose, mRNA expression from testis and liver tissue samples from 10 boars, 5 samples each for high and low androstenone levels were quantified and analyzed. The results shows that in testis samples 46 genes were differentially regulated whereas 25 genes showed differential expression in the liver. Digital gene expression analysis identified genes in keratin family, desmoplakin and Interferon-induced protein family for as candidate genes for low androstenone testis sample and genes in flavin monooxygenease family, cytochrome P450 family and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family as candidate genes for low androstenone liver sample. Additionally, the results revealed that mutations in genes IRG6, DSP, IFIT2 were specific for low androstenone testis tissues and mutations in genes FMO5, HIST1H4K and TSKU were specific for low androstenone liver samples.

To characterize the complex transcriptome changes in the endometrium in the course of initial conceptus attachment deep sequencing of endometrial RNA samples of pregnant animals (n=4) and corresponding cyclic controls (n=4) was performed using Illumina RNA-Seq. The obtained sequence reads were mapped to the porcine genome and relative expression values were calculated for the analysis of differential gene expression. Statistical analysis revealed 1,933 differentially expressed genes (FDR 1%), 1,229 with higher and 704 with lower mRNA concentration in the samples from pregnant animals. Expression of selected genes was validated by the use of quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The RNA-Seq data were compared to results of a microarray study of bovine endometrium on day 18 of pregnancy and additional related data sets. Bioinformatics analysis revealed for the genes with higher mRNA concentration in pregnant samples strong overrepresentation particularly for immune-related functional terms but also for apoptosis and cell adhesion. Overrepresented terms for the genes with lower mRNA concentration in pregnant samples were related to extracellular region, ion transport, cell adhesion and lipid and steroid metabolic process. In conclusion, RNA-Seq analysis revealed comprehensive transcriptome differences in porcine endometrium between day 14 of pregnancy and corresponding cyclic endometrium and highlighted new processes and pathways probably involved in regulation of non-invasive implantation in the pig.

It is particulary involved in the overall fatty acid synthesis with consequences in other lipid-target organs such as muscles and the liver. With this in mind, we have used massive, parallel high-throughput sequencing technologies to characterize the porcine adipose tissue transcriptome architecture in six Iberian x Landrace crossbred pigs showing extreme phenotypes for intramuscular fatty acid composition (three per group). High-throughput RNA sequencing was used to generate a whole characterization of adipose tissue (backfat) transcriptome. A total of 4,130 putative unannotated protein-coding sequences were identified in the 20% of reads which mapped in intergenic regions. Furthermore, 36% of the unmapped reads were represented by interspersed repeats, SINEs being the most abundant elements. Differential expression analyses identified 396 candidate genes among divergent animals for intramuscular fatty acid composition. Sixty-two percent of these genes (247/396) presented higher expression in the group of pigs with higher content of intramuscular SFA and MUFA, while the remaining 149 showed higher expression in the group with higher content of PUFA. Pathway analysis related these genes to biological functions and canonical pathways controlling lipid and fatty acid metabolisms. In concordance with the phenotypic classification of animals, the major metabolic pathway differentially modulated between groups was de novo lipogenesis, the group with more PUFA being the one that showed lower expression of lipogenic genes. These results will help in the identification of genetic variants at loci that affect fatty acid composition traits.

This experiment was conducted to investigate gene expression differences, transcriptional regulation and genetic polymorphisms that could be associated with the observed phenotypic differences between IB and IBxDU pigs. Nine IB and 10 IBxDU pigs were slaughtered at birth. Morphometric measures and blood samples were obtained and samples from Biceps femoris muscle were employed for compositional and transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq technology. Phenotypic differences were evident at this early age, including greater body size and weight in IBxDU and greater Biceps femoris intramuscular fat and plasma cholesterol content in IB newborns. We detected 150 differentially expressed genes between IB and IBxDU neonates (p < 0.01 and Fold-Change > 1. 5). Several were related to adipose and muscle tissues development (DLK1, FGF21 or UBC). The functional interpretation of the transcriptomic differences revealed enrichment of functions and pathways related to lipid metabolism in IB and to cellular and muscle growth in IBxDU. Protein catabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis and immune system were functions enriched in both genotypes. We identified transcription factors potentially affecting the observed gene expression differences. Some of them have known functions on adipogenesis (CEBPA, EGRs), lipid metabolism (PPARGC1B) and myogenesis (FOXOs, MEF2D, MYOD1), which suggest a key role in the meat quality differences existing between IB and IBxDU hams. We also identified several polymorphisms showing differential segregation between IB and IBxDU pigs. Among them, non-synonymous variants were detected in several transcription factors as PPARGC1B gene, which could be associated to altered gene function.

Addition of Dickkopf-related protein 1 improved the percentage of oocytes that matured to the metaphase II stage, increased the number of nuclei in the resulting blastocyst stage embryos, and in oocytes reduced the amount of disheveled segment polarity protein 1 protein. It is concluded that transcriptional profiling is a powerful method for detecting differences between in vitro and in vivo matured oocytes, and that the WNT signaling pathway is important for proper oocyte maturation."

As an ideal model for animal postnatal growth studies, the Bama minipig is characterized as having a lower growth performance and fewer individual differences compared with larger pig breeds. In this study, anterior pituitaries from Bama minipig and Landrace pig were used for miRNA and mRNA expression profile analysis using miRNA microarrays and mRNA-seq. Consequently, a total of 222 miRNAs and 12,909 transcripts were detected, and both miRNAs and mRNAs in the two breeds showed high correlation (r > 0.97). Additionally, 41 differentially expressed miRNAs and 2,254 transcripts were identified. Pathways analysis indicated that 32 pathways significantly differed in the two breeds. Importantly, two GH-regulation-signalling pathways, cAMP and inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate (IP3), and multiple GH-secretion-related transcripts were significantly down-regulated in Bama minipigs. Moreover, target prediction by two algorithms (TargetScan and RNAhybrid) indicated that most miRNA–mRNA target pairs (63.68–71.33%) presented a negatively correlated expression pattern. A possible network among miRNAs, mRNAs, and GH-regulation pathways was also proposed. These data will be helpful in understanding the possible molecular mechanisms involved in animal postnatal growth. Overall design: mRNA profiling in the anterior pituitary from two different pig breeds.2 pooled samples were analyzed. A pool of 3 pig anterior pituitary was used for Bama minpigs(YB) and Landrace pigs(YC),respectively."	"SRA"	"total"	"GSE68490, PRJNA282914"

However, the genetic mechanism underlying the phenotypic differentiation between the inflection point and asymptotic stages of the growth curve is not well characterized. Here, we employed Liangshan pigs in stages of growth at the inflection point (under inflection point: UIP) and the two asymptotic stages (before the inflection point: BIP, after the inflection point: AIP) as models to survey global gene expression in the longissimus dorsi muscle using digital gene expression (DGE) tag profiling. We found Liangshan pigs reached maximum growth rate (UIP) at 163.6 days of age and a weight of 134.6 kg. The DGE libraries generated 117 million reads of 5.89 gigabases in length. 21,331, 20,996 and 20,139 expressed transcripts were identified BIP, UIP and AIP, respectively. Among them, we identified 757 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BIP and UIP, and 271 DEGs between AIP and UIP. An enrichment analysis of DEGs proved the immune system was strengthened in the AIP stage. Energy metabolism rate, global transcriptional activity and bone development intensity were highest UIP. Meat from Liangshan pigs had the highest intramuscular fat content and most favorable fatty acid composition in the AIP. Three hundred eighty (27.70%) specific expression genes were highly enriched in QTL regions for growth and meat quality traits. This study completed a comprehensive analysis of diverse genetic mechanisms underlying the inflection point and asymptotic stages of growth. Our findings will serve as an important resource in the understanding of animal growth and development in indigenous pig breeds.

To understand some mechanisms of abnormal piglets with phenotypes such as macroglossia, standing and walking disabilities in our study and find some differences between abnormal piglets and conventionally bred normal piglets, DNA methylation profile and genome-wide gene expression were conducted in two groups, using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation binding highthroughput sequencing (MeDIP-Seq) and RNA sequencing(RNA-Seq). We generated and provided a genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profile for abnormal cloned and conventionally bred piglets. We detected a total of 1493 genes differentially expressed in two groups and 382 of these genes also differentially methylated in two groups. Analysis of relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression revealed that DNA methylation levels had significantly negative and monotonic correlation with gene expression levels in particular regions of genes while no obvious monotonic correlation in other regions. Besides, we found some interesting genes and pathways such as MYH7 and mTOR signalling pathway that may played essential role in muscle growth and development. Briefly, these results provide reliable data for future epigenetic studies and may help to uncover the mechanism of failure clones via SCNT. Overall design: We dissected the leg muscle from the cloned piglets and the conventionally bred piglets, and analyzed the difference of MeDIP-seq and RNA-seq between the two groups.

Little is known however about the molecular mechanisms underlying differences in sperm DNA fragmentation and an understanding of the genes controlling this sperm parameter could help in selecting the best boars for AI use. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes in testis of Norsvin Landrace and Duroc boars with good and bad sperm DNA fragmentation using transcriptome sequencing and to use the data for polymorphism search. RNA sequence reads were obtained using Illumina technology and mapped by TopHat using the Ensembl pig database. Differentially expressed genes and pathways were analyzed using the R Bioconductor packages edgeR and goseq respectively. Using a false discovery rate of 0.05, 309 and 375 genes were found displaying significant differences in expression level between the good and bad condition in Landrace and Duroc respectively. Of the differentially expressed genes, 72 were found in common for the two breeds. Gene ontology analysis revealed that terms common for the two breeds included extracellular matrix, extracellular region and calcium ion binding. Additionally, different metabolic processes were enriched in Landrace and Duroc, whereas immune response ontologies were found to be important in Landrace. SNP detection in Landrace/Duroc identified 53182/53931 variants in 10924/10748 transcripts and of these, 1573/1827 SNPs occurred in 189/241 unique genes that were also differentially expressed. Possible high impact variants were detected using SnpEff. Transcriptome sequencing identified differentially expressed genes and nucleotide variants related to differences in sperm DNA fragmentation, and functional annotation of the genes pointed towards important biochemical pathways. This study provides insights into the genetic network underlying this trait and is a first step towards using sperm DNA fragmentation for predicting boar fertility.

The objective of this study was to identify changes in the pig liver transcriptome induced by a diet enriched with omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, and to characterize the biological mechanisms related to PUFA metabolism. Polish Landrace pigs (n =12) were fed diet enriched with linoleic acid (LA, omega-6) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, omega-3 family) or standard diet as a control. The fatty acids profiling was assayed in order to verify how feeding influenced the fatty acids content in liver, and subsequently next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) between transcriptomes between dietary groups. The biological mechanisms and pathway interaction networks were identified by analysis in DAVID and Cytoscape tools. Fatty acids profile analysis indicated a higher contribution of PUFAs in liver for LA and ALA-enriched diet group, particularly for the omega-3 fatty acids family, but not omega-6. Next-generation sequencing identified 3,565 DEG, 1,484 of which were induced and 2,081 were suppressed by PUFA supplemenation. Low ratio of omega-6/-3 fatty acids resulted in modulation of fatty acids metabolism pathways and over-representation of genes involved in membrane composition, signal transduction and immune response pathways. In conclusion, a diet enriched with omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids altered the transcriptomic profile of the pig liver and affected a set of genes involved in metabolic pathways important to animal health status. Overall design: Hepatic mRNA profiles of Polish Landrace pig breed fed two different diets, were generated by deep sequencing, using Illumina MiSeq. Experimental diet was enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-6 and omega-3), while standard diet remain as a cotrol. 2 pooled samples each containing RNA extracts from 6 individuals livers were analyzed."

When compared with Western commercial pig breeds, Chinese indigenous pig breeds exhibited slower growth rates and reduced lean meat content but superior perceived meat quality. To study the factors that determine meat quality, we examined piglets of one Western commercial breed (Yorkshire) and one Chinese indigenous breed (Wannanhua) and sequenced the longissimus dorsi muscle using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We analyzed their transcriptomes, focusing on identifying candidate genes that may influence porcine muscle growth, meat quality and adipose deposition. Gene ontology functional enrichment and pathway enrichment analyses identified differentially expressed genes primarily associated with glycolytic metabolism, biological processes of muscle development and signaling pathways related to fatty acid metabolism, growth and carcass traits. This finding suggests that the differentially expressed genes may play important roles in determining meat quality traits. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed the differential expression of twelve selected differentially expressed genes. This study identified a number of novel candidate genes for porcine meat quality and carcass traits that merit further investigation to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for muscle growth and fat deposition.

Some documented evidences proved small RNAs (sRNA) and targeted genes are involved in mammalian testicular development and spermatogenesis. However, the detailed molecular regulation mechanisms of them remain largely unknown so far. We used the deep sequencing technology to characterize and identify the similarities and diversities of the expression and regulation of mRNAs, miRNAs and piRNAs which are possibly related to spermatogenesis and testicular development in different pig breeds at different stages of sexual maturity. In this study, we obtained a total of 10,716 mRNAs, 67 miRNAs and 16,953 piRNAs which were differentially expressed between LC and LW pig breeds or between the two sexual maturity stages. Of which, we identified 16 miRNAs and 28 targeted genes possibly related to spermatogenesis; 14 miRNAs and 18 targeted genes probably associated with cell adhesion related testis development. We also annotated 579 piRNAs which could potentially regulate cell death, nucleosome organization and other basic biology process, which implied that those piRNAs might be involved in sexual maturation difference. The integrated network analysis results suggested that some differentially expressed genes were involved in spermatogenesis through the ECMâ€“receptor interaction, focal adhesion, Wnt and PI3Kâ€“Akt signaling pathways, some particular miRNAs have the negative regulation roles and some special piRNAs have the positive and negative regulation roles in testicular development. Our data provide novel insights into the molecular expression and regulation similarities and diversities of spermatogenesis and testicular development in different pig breeds at different stages of sexual maturity. Overall design: LC and LW boars considerably differ in sexual maturation time; LW boars reach maturity at ~180 days old (Egbunike 1979), whereas LC boars reach maturity at 90 days old (Huang Ya-qiong et al. 2013). We dissected the testes from three LC and LW boars aged 20 days (sexual immaturity, B) and 200 days ( maturity, A).

The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in the muscle transcriptome and the biological functions regulated by increased consumption of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in the pig gluteus medius muscle. The transcriptome of the gluteus medius muscle was studied for pigs subjected to either a control diet or a diet supplemented with linseed and rapeseed oil to increase polyunsaturated fatty acid content. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to generate the muscle tissue transcriptome database. The results of the NGS indicate a role of the fatty acids in the regulation of the expression of genes essential for muscle tissue development and functioning. Functional analysis revealed that the identified genes were important for a number of biological processes including protein development, signaling, inflammatory response, membranes, and lipid metabolism. The genes that were expressed specifically in only one of the dietary groups were responsible for many of the same processes listed above, indicating that biological processes were strongly modulated and tended to switch between coherent stages in response to increased levels of n-6 and n-3 fatty acids. Several nuclear receptors regulating transcription showed altered expression, including hepatocyte nuclear factor-4a (HNF4alpha), carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP), and nuclear factor ?B (NFkappa?). We suggest that the identified changes were largely due to regulation of those transcription factors. Our results provide strong evidence that n-6 and n-3 fatty acids regulate fundamental metabolic processes in muscle tissue development and functioning. Overall design: Muscle mRNA profiles of Polish Landrace pig breed fed two different diets were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina MiSeq.

"Intramuscular fat (IMF) content in pork is an important element of consumer preference, and is positively correlated with meat quality, including tenderness and juiciness. With advances in RNA sequencing technologies, transcriptome-related differences can be associated with specific traits in animals. The objective of this study was to investigate the differentially expressed genes (DEG) closely related with IMF content in porcine longissimus muscle using RNA sequencing. A total of 107 Berkshire pigs were used for IMF content measurements and significant difference between extremely high (H, n=3) and low (L, n=3) IMF content groups was found (P < 0.0001). From multi-dimensional scaling analyses, it was observed that the relationships between H and L groups were similar to each other. Here, we identified a total of 134 genes that were differentially expressed between the groups (FDR < 0.05, and FC = 2). Functional analyses with DEGs revealed that the lipid metabolism (SCD and FASN) was one of the significant biological processes related with IMF content determination. In addition, we also found that DEGs related with muscle regeneration (MYOG and VEGFA) and extracellular matrix (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL5A1, COL14A1, and COL15A1) were changed between individuals with the extreme IMF contents, interestingly.

"SRP119071"	"Skin transcriptome of duck"	"Transcriptome profiles of skin and feather follicle from two body parts at three physiological stages were constructed to understand the molecular network and excavate the candidate genes associated with the plumulaceous and flight feathers structure. The key series-clusters, many candidate biological processes and genes were identified for the morphogenesis, growth and development of two feather types. Through comparing the results of developmental transcritpomes from plumulaceous and flight feather, we found that DEGs belonging to the family of WNT, FGF and BMP have certain differences; even the consistent DEGs of skin and feather follicle transcriptomes from abdomen and wing have the different expression patterns. Overall design: A total of twelve libraries were sequenced from skin and feather follicle tissues of six groups (n=2 for each; control samples), including the early growth plumulaceous feathers (EP), middle growth plumulaceous feathers (MP), late growth plumulaceous feathers (LP), early growth flight feathers (EF), middle growth flight feathers (MF) and late growth flight feathers (LF)."

"SRP141481"	"Differential expression and co-expression gene networks reveal candidate biomarkers of boar taint in non-castrated pigs (RNA-seq data set)"	"Boar taint (BT) is an offensive odour or taste observed in pork from a proportion of non-castrated male pigs. Surgical castration is effective in avoiding BT, but animal welfare issues have created an incentive for alternatives such as genomic selection. In order to find candidate biomarkers, gene expression profiles were analysed from tissues of non-castrated pigs grouped by their genetic merit of BT. Differential expression analysis revealed substantial changes with log-transformed fold changes of liver and testis from -3.39 to 2.96 and -7.51 to 3.53, respectively. Co-expression network analysis revealed one module with a correlation of -0.27 in liver and three modules with correlations of 0.31, -0.44 and -0.49 in testis. Differential expression and co-expression analysis revealed candidate biomarkers with varying biological functions: phase I (COQ3, COX6C, CYP2J2, CYP2B6, ACOX2) and phase II metabolism (GSTO1, GSR, FMO3) of skatole and androstenone in liver to steroidgenesis (HSD17B7, HSD17B8, CYP27A1), regulation of steroidgenesis (STARD10, CYB5R3) and GnRH signalling (MAPK3, MAP2K2, MAP3K2) in testis. Overrepresented pathways included “Ribosome”, “Protein export” and “Oxidative phosphorylation” in liver and “Steroid hormone biosynthesis” and “Gap junction” in testis. Future work should evaluate the biomarkers in large populations to ensure their usefulness in genomic selection programs. Overall design: Total RNA was extracted from liver and testis of 48 Danish Landrace pigs with low- medium and high genetic merit of boar taint and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2500."

We compared technical and biological replicates having undergone globin depletion or not and found that globin depletion removed approximately 80% of globin transcripts, improved the correlation of technical replicates, allowed for reliable detection of thousands of additional transcripts and generally increased transcript abundance measures. Overall design: Peripheral whole blood transcriptome assessed by RNA-Seq on Illumina HiSeq 2000 in 6 healthy individuals and 6 pooled samples, either globin depleted or not."
