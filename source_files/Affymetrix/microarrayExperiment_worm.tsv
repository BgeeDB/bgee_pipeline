"GSE23528"	"Light/dark- and temperature-regulated transcriptional rhythms in adult Caenorhabditis elegans"	"Most organisms have an endogenous circadian clock that is synchronized to environmental signals such as light and temperature. Although circadian rhythms have been described in the nematode C. elegans at the behavioral level, these rhythms appear to be relatively non-robust. Moreover, in contrast to other animal models, no circadian transcriptional rhythms have been identified. Thus, whether this simple nematode contains a bona fide circadian clock remains an open question.We used microarray experiments to identify light- and temperature-regulated transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans, and show that subsets of these transcripts are regulated in a circadian manner. In addition, we find that light and temperature also globally drive the expression of many genes, indicating that C. elegans exhibits systemic responses to these stimuli."

"#GSE30505"	"Members of the H3K4 trimethylation complex regulate lifespan in a germline-dependent manner in C. elegans"	"The plasticity of ageing suggests that longevity may be controlled epigenetically by specific alterations in chromatin state. The link between chromatin and ageing has mostly focused on histone deacetylation by the Sir2 family1, 2, but less is known about the role of other histone modifications in longevity. Histone methylation has a crucial role in development and in maintaining stem cell pluripotency in mammals3. Regulators of histone methylation have been associated with ageing in worms4, 5, 6, 7 and flies8, but characterization of their role and mechanism of action has been limited. Here we identify the ASH-2 trithorax complex9, which trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4), as a regulator of lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans in a directed RNA interference (RNAi) screen in fertile worms. Deficiencies in members of the ASH-2 complex—ASH-2 itself, WDR-5 and the H3K4 methyltransferase SET-2—extend worm lifespan. Conversely, the H3K4 demethylase RBR-2 is required for normal lifespan, consistent with the idea that an excess of H3K4 trimethylation—a mark associated with active chromatin—is detrimental for longevity. Lifespan extension induced by ASH-2 complex deficiency requires the presence of an intact adult germline and the continuous production of mature eggs. ASH-2 and RBR-2 act in the germline, at least in part, to regulate lifespan and to control a set of genes involved in lifespan determination. These results indicate that the longevity of the soma is regulated by an H3K4 methyltransferase/demethylase complex acting in the C. elegans germline."

"#GSE32031"	"Expression data in C. elegans L2 larvae after nhr-23 inhibition and in controls"	"NHR-23, a conserved member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, is required for normal development in C. elegans where it plays a critical role in growth and molting. In a search for NHR-23 dependent genes, we performed whole genome comparative expression microarrays on both control and nhr-23 inhibited synchronized larvae. Genes that decreased in response to nhr-23 RNAi included several collagen genes. Unexpectedly, several hedgehog-related genes were also down-regulated after nhr-23 RNAi. A homozygous nhr-23 deletion allele was used to confirm the RNAi knockdown phenotypes and the changes in gene expression. Our results indicate that NHR-23 is a critical coregulator of functionally linked genes involved in growth and molting and reveal evolutionary parallels among the ecdysozoa."

"GSE32521"	"Toxicogenomic responses of C. elegans to gold nanoparticles"	"We used Au nanoparticles (Au-NPs) as a model for studying particle specific effects of manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs) by examining the toxicogenomic responses in a model soil organism, free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Global genome expression for nematodes exposed to 4-nm citrate-coated Au-NPs at the LC10 (5.9 mg L-1) revealed significant differential expression of 797 genes. The levels of expression for five genes (apl-1, dyn-1, act-5, abu-11, and hsp-4) were confirmed independently with qRT-PCR. Seven common biological pathways associated with 38 of these genes were identified. Activation of 26 pqn/abu genes from noncanonical Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway and up-regulation of molecular chaperones (hsp-16.1, hsp-70, hsp-3 and hsp-4) were observed and are likely indicative of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Inhibition of abu-11 with RNAi showed increase in mortality in Au-NP exposed nematodes suggesting possible involvement of abu-11 (a gene associated with specific to C. elegans UPR) in a protective mechanism against Au-NPs. Exposure to Au-NPs also caused activation of genes involved in apoptosis and necrosis and resulted ultimately in 10% mortality. These results demonstrate that Au-NPs are bioavailable and cause adverse effects to a model ecoreceptor which activate both general and specific biological pathways."

"GSE34113"	"Expression Profiling of Caenorabditis elegans tdp-1 loss-of-function mutant"	"Transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) with diverse activities, is a common denominator in several neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Orthologs of TDP-43 exist from mammals to invertebrates, but their functions in lower organisms remain poorly understood. Here we systematically studied mutant Caenorhabditis elegans lacking the nematode TDP-43 ortholog, TDP-1. To understand the global gene expression regulation induced by the loss of tdp-1, the C. elegans transcriptomes were compared between the N2 WT animals and the tdp-1(ok803lf) mutant. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that the loss of TDP-1 altered expression of genes functioning in RNA processing and protein folding. These results suggest that the C. elegans TDP-1 as an RNA-processing protein may have a role in the regulation of protein homeostasis and aging. Global gene expression profiling was performed to compare the transcriptome of wild-type (N2) Caenorabditis elegans and that of tdp-1(ok803) loss-of-function mutant."

"GSE39252"	"Expression changes in Caenorhabditis elegans xpa-1 mutant"	"Background: The ability of an organism to repair DNA damage is implicated in carcinogenesis and aging. Interestingly expression profiling of Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) deficient segmental progeroid mice revealed gene expression changes resembling these observed in aged wild type animals. Our previous transcriptional profiling of NER-deficient C. elegans xpa-1 mutant showed overrepresentation of genes involved in lifespan determination and upregulation of several oxidative stress response genes (Fensgard et al. Aging 2010). However, since an independent study performed by Boyd and coworkers (Boyd et al. Mut Res 2010) showed limited number of changes in xpa-1 mutant. Therefore to independently validate that transcriptome modulation does take place in xpa-1 mutants, we performed another global gene expression profiling based on 5 independent biological replicates allowing more stringent statistical analysis. Results: In agreement with what was observed by Boyd and coworkers (Boyd et al. Mut Res 2010) current transcriptomic analysis detected fewer changes in xpa-1 C. elegans mutant with only a few genes regulated more than 4-fold. Nevertheless, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis performed on statistically significantly regulated unique protein coding genes revealed overrepresentation of aging gene cluster. Moreover, as before, overexpression of several genes involved in oxidative stress responses was detected. Conclusion: More stringent statistical analysis predictably resulted in a smaller number of regulated genes and thus overrepresented GOs comparing to the earlier paper. However, major conclusions of the previous study can be still regarded as valid, as the most important aging GO is still overrepresented.Activation of oxidative stress-responses and downregulation of insulin-like signaling (ILS) is seen in Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) deficient segmental progeroid mice. Evidence suggests that this is a survival response to persistent transcription-blocking DNA damage, although the relevant lesions have not been identified. Here we provide evidence for transcriptional reprogramming in NER-deficient C. elegans xpa-1 by transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. This reprograming is accompanied by increased intracellular ROS and ATP levels and lifespan shortening in xpa-1 mutant. Moreover we show that Base Excision Repair DNA glycosylase NTH-1 is upstream form the signaling events leading to transcriptomic changes, as its downregulation reverses overexpression of sod-3, gst-4 and aqp-1 genes, reduces intracellular ROS and ATP levels and reverses lifespan shortening observed in xpa-1 mutant. Surprisingly, however, these responses appear to not depend on cyclopurine levels, since these lesions are lower in xpa-1 C. elegans mutant than in the wild type. Finally, we also explore here which other upstream factors are necessary for transcriptional reprograming in xpa-1 mutant. "	"GEO"	"partial"	"available, downloaded"

"#GSE50513"	"Identify genes regulated by zip-2 in absence and presence of P. aeruginosa PA14 infection at 4h"	"Very little is known about how animals discriminate pathogens from innocuous microbes. To address this question, we examined infection-response gene induction in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We focused on genes that are induced in C. elegans by infection with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but are not induced by an isogenic attenuated gacA mutant. Most of these genes are induced independently of known immunity pathways. We generated a GFP reporter for one of these genes, infection response gene 1 (irg-1), which is induced strongly by wild-type P. aeruginosa strain PA14, but not by other C. elegans pathogens or by other wild-type P. aeruginosa strains that are weakly pathogenic to C. elegans. To identify components of the pathway that induces irg-1 in response to infection, we performed an RNA interference screen of C. elegans transcription factors. This screen identified zip-2, a bZIP transcription factor that is required for inducing irg-1, as well as several other genes, and is important for defense against infection by P. aeruginosa. These data indicate that zip-2 is part of a specialized pathogen response pathway that is induced by virulent strains of P. aeruginosa and provides defense against this pathogen."
