"E-TABM-33"	"Transcription profiling of zebrafish development"	"We are performing microarray experiments for expression profiling of zebrafish embryogenesis, both as a baseline for future analysis of mutant and other conditions and to validate our microarray technology. For our purpose we used the Affymetrix zebrafish array which contains approximately 15,000 genes. This represents about 50 % of the estimated number of zebrafish genes. Total RNA was collected from embryos at 16 different stages (zygote, shield stage, 75 % epiboly, 90 % epiboly, bud stage, 5-somite stage, 14-somite stage, prim-5 stage, 32 hpf and long-pec stage, 4d post fertilization (dpf), 5 dpf, 14 dpf, 30 dpf, 90 dpf, adult). Microarray analysis was performed with these stages in single colour experiments. After normalization, differential expressed genes were selected and further analyzed with GeneSpring software. In order to validate the microarray data and to assign biological functions we chose a few genes to do semi-quantitative real-time PCR. Many of the differentially expressed genes are unknown and could be candidates for regulatory genes identified in mutagenesis experiments. We identified several genes known to be involved in zebrafish organogenesis as well as novel genes with unique temporal expression patterns."	"ArrayExpress"	"total"

"GSE4201"	"Transcription profiling of Zebrafish embryos investigating the effect of miR-430 microRNA on deadenylation and clearance of maternal mRNAs"	"MicroRNAs comprise 1-3% of all vertebrate genes, but their in vivo functions and mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. Zebrafish miR-430 is expressed at the onset of zygotic transcription and regulates morphogenesis during early development. Using a microarray approach and in vivo target validation, we find that miR-430 directly regulates several hundred target mRNAs. Targets are highly enriched for maternal mRNAs that accumulate in the absence of miR-430. We also show that miR-430 accelerates the deadenylation of target mRNAs. These results suggest that miR-430 facilitates the deadenylation and clearance of maternal mRNAs during early embryogenesis. Experiment Overall Design: As a first step towards the identification of miR-430 targets, we compared the rate of mRNA degradation in wild type and maternal-zygotic (MZ) dicer mutant embryos, which are deficient in miRNA processing. We found that the rate of degradation of a target mRNA with partial complementarity to miR-430 is significantly reduced in MZdicer mutants. Providing miR-430 duplexes to MZdicer mutants restores the rate of target decay. These results indicate that miR-430 enhances the decay of target mRNAs. Experiment Overall Design: To identify miR-430 in vivo targets, we compared the mRNA expression profile of embryos that were wild-type, MZdicer, or MZdicer rescued with miR-430 (MZdicer+miR-430). This analysis identified ~600 genes that were upregulated in MZdicer, but not in MZdicer+miR-430. Experiment Overall Design: We have also analyzed the expression profile of the genes in the array at three different time points, one maternal stage(16 cell), and two Zygotic stages 5 hours and 9 hours"	"GEO"	"partial"

SCA1 is caused by an expanded polyglutamine within Atxn1 by gain-of-function mechanisms.

"GSE2507"	"Transcription profiling of skeletal and cardiac muscles in dysferlin-deficient SJL/J mice and wild type mice to understand the protective mechanisms against dysferlin deficiency in cardiac muscles."	"Dysferlin is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. However, dysferlin deficiency, namely limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) and Myoshi myopathy, results in skeletal muscle weakness and spares the heart. This dichotomy could be caused by differential regulation of protective mechanisms. Therefore, we compared intraindividual mRNA expression profiles between cardiac and skeletal muscle in dysferlin-deficient SJL/J mice and normal C57BL/6 mice. Experiment Overall Design: 20 chips were analyzed. They represent 4 groups of 5 replicates each. Experiment Overall Design: The 4 groups are cardiac (LV) and skeletal muscle of normal and dysferlin deficient mice.

"GSE6443"	"Transcription profiling of jejunums from wild type and Klf9-/- mice to investigate the involvement of Klf9 in small intestine crypt-villus cell renewal and lineage determination."	"Kr ppel-like factor 9 (Klf9), a zinc-finger transcription factor, is implicated in the control of cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell fate in brain and uterus. Using Klf9 null mutant mice, we have investigated the involvement of Klf9 in small intestine crypt-villus cell renewal and lineage determination. We report the predominant expression of Klf9 gene in small intestine smooth muscle (muscularis externa). Jejunums null for Klf9 have shorter villi, reduced crypt stem/transit cell proliferation, and altered lineage determination as indicated by decreased and increased numbers of Goblet and Paneth cells, respectively. A stimulatory role for Klf9 in villus cell migration was demonstrated by BrdU labeling. Results suggest that Klf9 controls the elaboration, from small intestine smooth muscle, of molecular mediator(s) of crypt cell proliferation and lineage determination, and of villus cell migration. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was extracted in parallel from the jejunums of five WT and five Klf9-/- male mice (PND 30) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Conversion of each RNA preparation to corresponding fragmented cRNA. Fifteen ug of each cRNA was hybridized for 16 hours to an Affymetrix mouse 430A GeneChip. Ten GeneChips (each corresponding to a single animal) were hybridized, washed and scanned in parallel. Following the wash, signal amplification, and signal detection steps, GeneChips were scanned (Agilent GeneArray laser scanner) and the resultant images quantified using Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software."

"GSE558"	"Transcription profiling of transgenic mice constitutively active for caPI3K and dominant-negative forms of PI3K (dnPI3K) to test if the insulin/IGF-IRS-PI3K-Akt determines organ size in vertebrates"	"The insulin/IGF-IRS-PI3K-Akt pathway is highly conserved in evolution. To test whether this signaling cascade determines organ size in vertebrates, we have recently created mouse lines transgenic for constitutively active (caPI3K) and dominant-negative forms of PI3K (dnPI3K) (Shioi et al., 2000). Transgene expression is driven by the cardiac-specific a -myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter. Both transgenic lines are characterized by moderate but highly consistent changes in heart size, despite the fact that body weight and the size of other organs are completely normal. caPI3K transgenic animals have hearts 20% larger than those of wild type littermates, whereas dnPI3K mice have hearts that are 17% smaller. The observed changes in heart size correlate with an appropriate increase or decrease in the size of transgenic cardiomyocytes. These hearts do not have cardiomyopathic changes, since the contractile function of transgenic hearts is normal, and signs of necrosis, apoptosis, or interstitial fibrosis are absent (see Physiology). These data suggest an autonomous role for PI3K in cell size regulation. Our goal is now to determine how activation of this system translates into changes in cell size by identifying the trigger and components of this signaling cascade. Heterozygous caPI3K (constitutively active PI3K) and dnPI3K (dominant-negative PI3K) transgenic female mice (5-14 months) compared with non-transgenic littermates.

Three biological replicate array experiments were finished for each condition and MAS5.0 signal were used to do data analysis. Forty-four transcripts with expression differences higher than 2-fold were detected(T test, P<0.05), including Tbx4, Tbx5, Hoxc10 and Pitx1 which were previously shown to be differentially expressed in developing forelimb and hindlimb bud by in situ hybridization and SAGE study (Margulies 2001). RTPCR and in situ experiments confirmed several top differentially expressed genes which were newly discovered by our experiments. Vast amount of transcripts and its family members such as Bmp, Fgf, Epha, Wnt, T-box and Hox families detected to be highly expressed or differentially expressed in developing autopods, suggesting that the complexity of transcriptomes of developing autopods and dynamic differential expression and differential combinations of gene expression signals in the developing limb tissue contributes to differences in forelimb versus hindlimb patterning. The differentially expressed genes are the essential factors for morphological diversification of developing limb structures."	"GEO"	"total"

"GSE2005"	"Transcription profiling of mouse hippocampi from transgenic mice vs their non-transgenic littermates"	"Post-transcriptional mechanisms play an important role in the control of gene expression. RNA-binding proteins are key players in the post-transcriptional control of many neural genes and they participate in multiple processes, from RNA splicing and mRNA transport to mRNA stability and translation. Our laboratory has developed the first mouse model overexpressing a RNA-binding protein, the ELAV-like protein HuD, in the CNS under the control of the CaMKinII alpha promoter. Initial behavioral characterization of the mice revealed that they had significant learning deficits together with abnormalities in prepulse inhibition (PPI). At the molecular level, we found that the expression of the growth-associated protein GAP-43, one of the targets of HuD, was increased in the hippocampus of HuD transgenic mice. To characterize these mice further and to evaluate the utility of these animals in understanding human diseases, we propose to use DNA microarray methods. To test our hypothesis we propose 2 specific aims: 1)To characterize the pattern of gene expression in the hippocampus of HuD overexpressor mice 2)To compare the pattern of gene expression in our mouse model with that in the hippocampus of rats prenatally exposed to alcohol (FAS model) and in post-mortem tissues of patients with schizophrenia; Based on the behavioral and molecular properties of our HuD transgenic mice we hypothesize that these animals may be good models for the studying the basis of learning disabilities and of diseases that show deficits in PPI such as fetal alcohol syndrome and schizophrenia. All mice are in C57BL/6 background and are male approximately 60 days old. Initial studies were performed in animals that were not subjected to any experimental manipulation. Animals were bred and sacrificed according to our approved animal protocol. The brain was rapidly dissected on ice and we isolated the hippocampus, which has the highest expression of the transgene. After dissection both hippocampi were frozen in liquid nitrogen, pooled and stored at -80 C until analysis. RNA samples were isolated using RNAeasy Qiagen columns. For our first experiment, we want to examine the pattern of gene expression in the hippocampus of 3 transgenic mice and 3 non-transgenic littermates. RNAs from the 6 hippocampi were of high quality as revealed by the integrity of the 28S and 18S rRNA. We will provide 6 samples containing 10 ug of RNA each in DEPC water at a concentration of about 0.5 ug/ul.

"GSE5429"	"Transcription profiling of hippocapus from eight different inbred mouse strains to identify substantial strain-specific variation in hippocampal gene expression"	"Mouse inbred strains differ in many aspects of their phenotypes, and it is known that gene expression does so too. This gives us an opportunity to isolate the genetic aspect of variation in expression and compare it to other phenotypic variables. We have investigated these issues using an eight-strain expression profile comparison with four replicates per strain on Affymetrix MGU74av2 GeneChips focusing on one well-defined brain tissue (the hippocampus). We identified substantial strain-specific variation in hippocampal gene expression, with more than two hundred genes showing strain differences by a very conservative criterion. Many such genetically driven differences in gene expression are likely to result in functional differences including differences in behaviour. A large panel of inbred strains could be used to identify genes functionally involved in particular phenotypes, similar to genetic correlation. The genetic correlation between expression profiles and function is potentially very powerful, especially given the current large-scale generation of phenotypic data on multiple strains (the Mouse Phenome Project). As an example, the strongest genetic correlation between more than 200 probe sets showing significant differences among our eight inbred strains and a ranking of these strains by aggression phenotype was found for Comt, a gene known to be involved in aggression. Experiment Overall Design: Total hippocampal RNA was extracted from eight inbred strains of mice and pooled within each strain (six mice/pool, one pool/strain). cDNA samples (eight) were prepared from the total hippocampal RNA and cRNA was prepared twice from cDNA. (Samples labelled 1 & 2 for each strain were from the first cRNA synthesis preparation, samples labelled 3 & 4 for each strain were from the second cRNA synthesis preparation).Each set of cRNA samples (16 in total) were then hybridized in duplicate to the Murine Genome U74Av2 Array (Chip A; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, USA).

"E-MEXP-939"	"Transcription profiling of skeletal muscle from wild type and PGC-1 beta transgenic mice"	"Skeletal muscle must perform a wide range of kinds of work, and different fiber types have evolved to accommodate these different tasks. The attributes of fibers are determined in large part by the coordinated regulation of oxidative capacity, as reflected by mitochondrial content, and the specific makeup of myofibrillar proteins. Adult muscle fibers contain four myosin heavy chain isotypes: I, IIa, IIx and IIb. Type I and IIa fibers have slower twitches and are rich in mitochondria, while type IIb fibers are fast-twitch and predominantly glycolytic. The intermediate IIx fibers are less well understood. Previous work had shown that the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1 alpha could drive the formation of type I and IIa muscle fibers. We show here that mice with transgenic expression of PGC-1 beta in skeletal muscle results in marked induction of IIx fibers. The fibers in transgenic mice are rich in mitochondria and are highly oxidative. As a result, PGC-1 beta transgenic animals can perform oxidative activity for longer and at higher work loads than wild type animals. In cell culture, PGC-1 beta coactivates the MEF2 family of transcription factors to stimulate the MHC IIx promoter. Together, these data indicate that PGC-1 beta is sufficient to drive the formation in vivo of highly oxidative fibers with type IIx characteristics."	"ArrayExpress"	"partial"

Individuals with NF1 develop growths that define the NF1 phenotype, including Lisch nodules, cafe-au-lait spots, and neurofibromas. However, more than 50% of individuals with NF1 have cognitive deficits, such as learning disorders and attention deficit/hyperactive disorder that are neuroanatomically unrelated to the neurofibromas. The purpose of this study is to determine the molecular basis of the neurodevelopmental changes that result from the primary gene mutation using a mouse model of NF. These mice are heterozygous for the Nf1 gene (NF+/-), and develop learning and memory difficulties that mimic humans, but do not develop tumors. By applying the technique of gene expression profiling to both NF+/- and control mice, we expect get a genetic fingerprint of 12,000 RNA molecules expressed in different parts of the brain during development. Comparison of the genetic fingerprints in these mice during development may help us identify key molecular changes that eventually result in cognitive deficits. Such an understanding of the molecular changes triggered by the primary gene mutation may eventually lead to treatments that prevent the cognitive deficits in NF1."	"GEO"	"partial"

Bcl-xl, an antiapoptotic protein is induced at end-stages of differentiation of erythroid precursors in response to erythropoietin. The details of the proapoptotic pathway and the critical proapoptotic proteins inhibited by Bcl-xl in erythropoiesis are not well understood. We employed gene targeting to ablate Nix, a proapoptotic BH3-domain only Bcl2 family protein, which is known to be transcriptionally induced during erythropoiesis. Nix null mice exhibited reticulocytosis and thrombocytosis in the peripheral blood; and profound splenomegaly with erythroblastosis in the spleen and bone marrow despite normal erythropoietin levels and blood oxygen tension. In vivo apoptosis was diminished in erythroblast precursors from Nix null spleens. To define the molecular consequences of Nix ablation on apoptosis and erythropoiesis, we conducted a detailed comparative analysis of gene expression in spleens from 8 week old Nix null mice and wild type controls.

Attie*, ; Departments of * Biochemistry, and Statistics and Horticulture, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, 53706; and Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA 95051 ; Communicated by Neal L. First, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, July 13, 2000 (received for review April 3, 2000) ; Obesity is strongly correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a common disorder of glucose and lipid metabolism. Although adipocytes are critical in obesity, their role in diabetes has only recently been appreciated. We conducted studies by using DNA microarrays to identify differences in gene expression in adipose tissue from lean, obese, and obese-diabetic mice. The expression level of over 11,000 transcripts was analyzed, and 214 transcripts showed significant differences between lean and obese mice. Surprisingly, the expression of genes normally associated with adipocyte differentiation were down-regulated in obesity. Not all obese individuals will become diabetic; many remain normoglycemic despite profound obesity. Understanding the transition to obesity with concomitant diabetes will provide important clues to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we examined the levels of gene expression in adipose tissue from five groups of obese mice with varying degrees of hyperglycemia, and we identified 88 genes whose expression strongly correlated with diabetes severity. This group included many genes that are known to be involved in signal transduction and energy metabolism as well as genes not previously examined in the context of diabetes. Our data show that a decrease in expression of genes normally involved in adipogenesis is associated with obesity, and we further identify genes important for subsequent development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

"Several studies have shown that bone mineral density (BMD), a clinically measurable predictor of osteoporotic fracture, is the sum of genetic and environmental influences. In addition, serum IGF-1 levels have been correlated to both BMD and fracture risk. We previously identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) for Bone Mineral Density (BMD) on mouse Chromosome (Chr) 6 that overlaps a QTL for serum IGF-1. The B6.C3H-6T (6T) congenic mouse is homozygous for C57BL/6J (B6) alleles across the genome except for a 30 cM region on Chr 6 that is homozygous for C3H/HeJ (C3H) alleles. This mouse was created to study biology behind both the BMD and the serum IGF-1 QTLs and to identify the gene(s) underlying these QTLs. Female 6T mice have lower BMD and lower serum IGF-1 levels at all ages measured. As the liver is the major source of serum IGF-1, we examined differential expression in the livers of fasted female B6 and 6T mice by microarray. Experiment Overall Design: The experimental design of this experiment was a simple two-factor experiment, with three biological replicates of each factor (in this case mouse strain, B6.C3H-6T vs. C57BL/6J). Each sample represented one mouse; no samples were pooled. No technical replicated were done."	"GEO"	"partial"

Elucidation of human bulge cell biology could be facilitated by analysis of global gene expression profiles and identification of unique cell-surface markers. The lack of distinctive bulge morphology in human hair follicles has hampered studies of bulge cells and KSCs. In this study, we determined the distribution of label-retaining cells to define the human anagen bulge. Using navigated laser capture microdissection, bulge cells and outer root sheath cells from other follicle regions were obtained and analyzed with cDNA microarrays. Gene transcripts encoding inhibitors of WNT and activin/bone morphogenic protein signaling were overrepresented in the bulge, while genes responsible for cell proliferation were underrepresented, consistent with the existence of quiescent noncycling KSCs in anagen follicles. Positive markers for bulge cells included CD200, PHLDA1, follistatin, and frizzled homolog 1, while CD24, CD34, CD71, and CD146 were preferentially expressed by non-bulge keratinocytes. Importantly, CD200+ cells (CD200hiCD24loCD34loCD71loCD146lo) obtained from hair follicle suspensions demonstrated high colony-forming efficiency in clonogenic assays, indicating successful enrichment of living human bulge stem cells.

"GSE9913"	"Transcription profiling of mouse intestine in ENU mutagenesis mouse strains with missense mutations in Muc2 mucin and ER stress"	"Background; MUC2 mucin produced by intestinal goblet cells is the major component of the intestinal mucus barrier. MUC2 homo-oligomerizes intracellularly into large secreted polymers which give mucus its viscous properties. The inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ulcerative colitis is characterized by depleted goblet cells and a reduced mucus layer, whereas goblet cells and the mucus layer are increased in the other major inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn s disease. Methods and Findings; By murine N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenesis we identified two distinct non-complementing missense mutations in Muc2 exons encoding N- and C-terminal homo-oligomerization domains causing an ulcerative colitis-like phenotype. Both strains developed mild spontaneous distal intestinal inflammation, chronic diarrhea, rectal bleeding and prolapse, increased susceptibility to acute and chronic colitis induced by a luminal toxin, aberrant Muc2 biosynthesis, smaller goblet cell thecae (less stored mucin) and a diminished mucus barrier. Enhanced local production of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma was seen in the distal colon. The number of leukocytes within mesenteric lymph nodes was increased five-fold and leukocytes cultured in vitro produced both Th1 and Th2 cytokines (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-13). Intestinal permeability was increased and the luminal bacterial flora were more heavily coated with immunoglobulin as occurs in IBD. This pathology was accompanied by accumulation of the Muc2 precursor and ultrastructural and biochemical evidence of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in goblet cells, activation of the unfolded protein response, and altered intestinal expression of genes involved in ER stress, inflammation, apoptosis and wound repair. Expression of mutated Muc2 oligomerization domains in vitro demonstrated that aberrant Muc2 oligomerization underlies the ER stress. These models show that mutations in Muc2 oligomerization domains can lead to aberrant assembly of the Muc2 complex leading to ER stress, a depleted mucus barrier and intestinal inflammation. In ulcerative colitis we demonstrate similar accumulation of non-glycosylated MUC2 precursor in goblet cells together with ultrastructural and biochemical evidence of ER stress even in non-inflamed intestinal tissue. Conclusions; The observations that mucin misfolding and ER stress lead directly to intestinal inflammation and that ER stress and goblet cell pathology occur in ulcerative colitis suggest that ER stress-related mucin depletion could be a fundamental component of the pathogenesis of colitis. Experiment Overall Design: 3 individual mice from the Eeyore, Winnie or Wild-type strains were compared as groups.

"GSE2118"	"Transcription profiling of wild type and Atm-/- mouse lymph nodes treated with ionizing radiation"	"The DNA damage response network modulates a wide array of signaling pathways, including DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints, apoptotic pathways and numerous stress signals. The ATM protein kinase, functionally missing in patients with the human genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), is a master regulator of this network when the inducing DNA lesions are double strand breaks. The ATM gene is also frequently mutated in sporadic cancers of lymphoid origin. Here, we applied a functional genomics approach that combines gene expression profiling and computational promoter analysis to obtain global dissection of the transcriptional response to ionizing radiation (IR) in murine lymphoid tissue. Cluster analysis revealed six major expression patterns in the data. Prominent among them was a gene cluster that contained dozens of genes whose response to irradiation was Atm-dependent. Computational analysis identified significant enrichment of the binding site signatures of the transcription factors NF-kB and p53 among promoters of these genes, pointing to the major role of these two transcription factors in mediating the Atm-dependent transcriptional response in the irradiated lymphoid tissue. Examination of the response showed that pro- and anti-apoptotic signals were simultaneously induced, with the pro-apoptotic pathway mediated by p53, and the pro-survival pathway by NF-kB. These findings further elucidate the molecular network induced by IR and have implications for cancer management as they suggest that a combined treatment that restores the p53-mediated apoptotic arm while blocking the NF-kB-mediated pro-survival arm could be most successful in increasing the radiosensitivity of lymphoid tumors."

Dysregulation of beta-catenin expression has been described in pancreatic neoplasia. Newly published studies have suggested that beta-catenin is critical for normal pancreatic development although these reports reached somewhat different conclusions. In addition, the molecular mechanisms by which loss of beta-catenin affects pancreas development are not well understood. The goals of this study then were; 1] to further investigate the role of beta-catenin in pancreatic development using a conditional knockout approach and 2] to identify possible mechanisms by which loss of beta-catenin disrupts pancreatic development.

"There is massive destruction of transcripts during maturation of mouse oocytes. The objective of this project was to identify and characterize the transcripts that are degraded versus those that are stable during the transcriptionally silent germinal vesicle (GV)-stage to metaphase II (MII)-stage transition using the microarray approach. A system for oocyte transcript amplification using both internal and 3'-poly(A) priming was utilized to minimize the impact of complex variations in transcript polyadenylation prevalent during this transition. Transcripts were identified and quantified using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 v2.0 GeneChip. The significantly changed and stable transcripts were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis and GenMAPP/MAPPFinder to characterize the biological themes underlying global changes in oocyte transcripts during maturation. It was concluded that the destruction of transcripts during the GV to MII transition is a selective rather than promiscuous process in mouse oocytes. In general, transcripts involved in processes that are associated with meiotic arrest at the GV-stage and the progression of oocyte maturation, such as oxidative phosphorylation, energy production, and protein synthesis and metabolism, were dramatically degraded. In contrast, transcripts encoding participants in signaling pathways essential for maintaining the unique characteristics of the MII-arrested oocyte, such as those involved in protein kinase pathways, were the most prominent among those stables.

Furthermore, targeted deletion of the muscle-specific miRNA, miR-1-2, revealed numerous functions in the heart, including regulation of cardiac morphogenesis, electrical conduction, and cell cycle control. Analyses of miR-1 complementary sequences in mRNAs upregulated upon miR-1-2 deletion revealed an enrichment of miR-1 seed matches"" and a strong tendency for potential miR-1 binding sites to be located in physically accessible regions.

"E-AFMX-1"	"Transcription profiling of human, chimp and mouse brain"	"Microarray technologies allow the identification of large numbers of expression differences within and between species. Although environmental and physiological stimuli are clearly responsible for changes in the expression levels of many genes, it is not known whether the majority of changes of gene expression fixed during evolution between species and between various tissues within a species are caused by Darwinian selection or by stochastic processes. We find the following: (1) expression differences between species accumulate approximately linearly with time; (2) gene expression variation among individuals within a species correlates positively with expression divergence between species; (3) rates of expression divergence between species do not differ significantly between intact genes and expressed pseudogenes; (4) expression differences between brain regions within a species have accumulated approximately linearly with time since these regions emerged during evolution. These results suggest that the majority of expression differences observed between species are selectively neutral or nearly neutral and likely to be of little or no functional significance. Therefore, the identification of gene expression differences between species fixed by selection should be based on null hypotheses assuming functional neutrality. Furthermore, it may be possible to apply a molecular clock based on expression differences to infer the evolutionary history of tissues."

Exposure to phosgene results in a latent (1-24 hr), potentially life-threatening pulmonary edema and irreversible acute lung injury. A genomic approach was utilized to investigate the molecular mechanism of phosgene-induced lung injury. CD-1 male mice were exposed whole-body to either air or a concentration x time (c x t) amount of 32 mg/m3 (8 ppm) phosgene for 20 min (640 mg x min/m3). Lung tissue was collected from air- or phosgene-exposed mice at 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr post-exposure. RNA was extracted from the lung and used as starting material for the probing of oligonucleotide microarrays to determine changes in gene expression following phosgene exposure. The data were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the greatest sources of data variability. A three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on exposure, time, and sample was performed to identify the genes most significantly changed as a result of phosgene exposure. These genes were rank ordered by p-values and categorized based on molecular function and biological process. Some of the most significant changes in gene expression reflect changes in glutathione synthesis and redox regulation of the cell, including upregulation of glutathione S-transferase alpha-2, glutathione peroxidase 2, and glutamate-cysteine ligase, catalytic subunit (also known as -glutamyl cysteine synthetase). This is in agreement with previous observations describing changes in redox enzyme activity after phosgene exposure.

"Presbycusis is characterized by an age-related progressive decline of auditory function, and arises mainly from the degeneration of hair cells or spiral ganglion (SG) cells in the cochlea. Here we show that caloric restriction suppresses apoptotic cell death in the mouse cochlea and prevents late onset of presbycusis. Caloric restricted mice, which maintained body weight at the same level as that of young control (YC) mice, retained normal hearing and showed no cochlear degeneration. CR mice also showed significantly fewer TUNEL-positive staining cells and fewer cleaved caspase-3-positive staining cells relative to middle-age control (MC) mice. Microarray analysis revealed that CR down-regulated the expression of 28 proapoptotic genes, including Bak and Bim. Taken together, our findings suggest that loss of critical cells through apoptosis is an important mechanism of presbycusis in mammals, and that CR or staying lean can retard this process by suppressing apoptosis in the inner ear tissue. Experiment Overall Design: To examine the effects of aging, a comparison of cochlea tissues from YC (3 samples) and MC (3 samples) mice was conducted.

"GSE7674"	"Transcription profiling of mouse G9a-/- knockouts vs controls reveals G9a histone methyltransferase maintains genomic imprinting IN THE mouse placenta."	"Whereas DNA methylation is essential for genomic imprinting, the importance of histone methylation in the allelic repression of imprinted genes is unclear. Imprinting control regions (ICRs), however, are consistently marked by histone H3 K9 methylation on their DNA-methylated allele. In the placenta, the paternal silencing along the Kcnq1 domain on distal chromosome 7 also correlates with the presence of H3-K9 methylation, but imprinted repression at these genes is maintained independently of DNA methylation. To explore which histone methyltransferase (HMT) could mediate the allelic H3-K9 methylation on distal chromosome 7, and at ICRs, we generated mouse conceptuses deficient for the SET-domain protein G9a. We find that in the embryo and placenta, the differential DNA methylation at ICRs and imprinted genes is maintained in the absence of G9a. Accordingly, in embryos, imprinted gene expression is unchanged at the domains analysed, in spite of a global loss of H3-K9 di-methylation (H3K9me2). In contrast, the placenta-specific imprinting of genes on distal chromosome 7 is lost in the absence of G9, and this correlates with a loss of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3. These findings provide the first in vivo evidence for the involvement of a SET domain protein in imprinting and highlight the importance of histone lysine methylation rather than DNA methylation in the maintenance of imprinting in the trophoblast lineage.

Here, complete inactivation of NER in Csbm/m/Xpa-/- mutants causes a phenotype that reliably mimics the human progeroid CS syndrome. Newborn Csbm/m/Xpa-/- mice display attenuated growth, progressive neurological dysfunction, retinal degeneration, cachexia, kyphosis and die before weaning. To investigate whether a disturbance in growth and metabolism could explain the pronounced accelerated organismal deterioration seen in Csbm/m/Xpa-/- mice, we evaluated the liver transcriptome of 15-day old wt, single and double mutant mice (n=4). At this age, the Csbm/m/Xpa-/- pups have not yet become cachectic. Mouse liver transcriptome analysis and several physiological endpoints revealed systemic suppression of the GH/IGF1 somatotroph axis and oxidative metabolism, increased antioxidant responses, hypoglycemia together with hepatic glycogen and fat accumulation. Broad genome-wide parallels between Csbm/m/Xpa-/- and naturally aged mouse liver transcriptomes suggested that these changes are intrinsic to natural aging and the DNA repair-deficient mice. Importantly, wild type (wt) mice exposed to a low dose of chronic genotoxic stress and adult Csbm/m mutant mice recapitulated this response, thereby pointing to a novel link between genome instability and the age-related decline of the somatotroph axis."

"GSE2926"	"Transcription profiling of livers from SCD1 knockout and wild type mice to elucidate the molecular basis of protection against adiposity in mice lacking of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 function"	"Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is a central lipogenic enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, mainly oleate (C18:1) and palmitoleate (C16:1), which are components of membrane phospholipids, triglycerides, wax esters, and cholesterol esters. Several SCD isoforms (SCD1-3) exist in the mouse. Here we show that mice with a targeted disruption of the SCD1 isoform have reduced body adiposity, increased insulin sensitivity, and are resistant to diet-induced weight gain. The protection from obesity involves increased energy expenditure and increased oxygen consumption. Compared with the wild-type mice the SCD1-/- mice have increased levels of plasma ketone bodies but reduced levels of plasma insulin and leptin. In the SCD1-/- mice, the expression of several genes of lipid oxidation are up-regulated, whereas lipid synthesis genes are down-regulated. These observations suggest that a consequence of SCD1 deficiency is an activation of lipid oxidation in addition to reduced triglyceride synthesis and storage. Experiment Overall Design: RNA was isolated from livers of 10 individual 6-week-old female mice by using a standard method. Mouse genome U74A arrays were used to monitor the expression level of approximately 10,000 genes and expressed sequence tags (Affymetrix).

Although the basic laminar structure of the PFC is established in utero, extensive remodeling continues into adolescence. To map the overall pattern of changes in cortical gene transcripts during post-natal development, we made serial measurements of mRNA levels in mouse PFC using oligonucleotide microarrays. We observed changes in mRNA transcripts consistent with known post-natal morphological and biochemical events. Overall, most transcripts that changed significantly showed a progressive decrease in abundance after birth, with the majority of change between post-natal weeks 2 and 4. Genes with cell proliferative, cytoskeletal, extracellular matrix, plasma membrane lipid / transport, protein folding, and regulatory functions had decreases in mRNA levels. Quantitative PCR verified the microarray results for six selected genes: DNA methyltransferase 3A (Dnmt3a), procollagen, type III, alpha 1 (Col3a1), solute carrier family 16 (monocarboxylic acid transporters), member 1 (Slc16a1), MARCKS-like 1 (Marcksl1), nidogen 1 (Nid1) and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (heart, mitochondrial) (Bdh).

In the hope of identifying PAR bZip target genes whose altered expression might contribute to the high morbidity and mortality of PAR bZip triple knockout mice, we compared the liver and kidney transcriptomes of these animals to those of wild-type or heterozygous mutant mice. These experiments revealed that PAR bZip proteins control the expression of many enzymes and regulators involved in detoxification and drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes, carboxylesterases, and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR).

The hybridized RNA was isolated from cells obtained with laser capture microdissection, then was amplified and labeled using T7 polymerase-based in vitro transcription. The expression of 53 genes was found to differ significantly (33 upregulated, 20 downregulated) in normal versus tumor tissues under two independent statistical methods. The expression changes in four selected genes (LGALS1, MMP1, LAGY, and KRT4) were confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Two-dimensional hierarchical clustering of the 53 genes resulted in the samples clustering according to the extent of tumor infiltration: normal epithelial tissue, tumors less than or equal to 4 cm in dimension, and tumors more than 4 cm in dimension (P=0.0014). The same pattern of clustering was also observed for the 20 downregulated genes. We did not observe any associations with lymph node metastasis (P=0.097). Experiment Overall Design: We performed microarray analysis using RNA from OSCC cells obtained with LCM from 16 patients and compared these results with 4 control squamous cell epithelium samples.We identified expression profiles of differentially expressed genes between normal and tumor tissues and found that tumor invasiveness of a tumor is highly correlated with its gene expression profile."

"GSE7540"	"Transcription profiling of brain samples from human and chimpanzee subjects"	"The origin of humans was accompanied by the emergence of new behavioral and cognitive functions, including language and specialized forms of abstract representation. However, the molecular foundations of these human capabilities are poorly understood. Because of the extensive similarity between human and chimpanzee DNA sequences, it has been suggested that many of the key phenotypic differences between species result primarily from alterations in the regulation of genes rather than in their sequences. To characterize gene expression patterns accross the brain and investigate the genetic basis of human specializations in brain organization and cognition, we used microarrays to quantify the transcript levels of thousands of genes in tissue samples from different brain regions of several human and chimpanzee individuals. Our results indicated that the human brain displays a distinctive pattern of gene expression relative to non-human primates, with higher expression levels for many genes belonging to a wide variety of functional classes. The increased expression of these genes could provide the basis for extensive modifications of cerebral physiology and function in humans, and suggests that the human brain is characterized by elevated levels of neuronal activity. Experiment Overall Design: Gene-expression profiling was performed on 32 tissue samples from different brain regions of a total of 7 humans and 4 chimpanzees.

Previous studies have shown that transgenic over-expression of the transcription factor HNF6 specifically in the pancreatic endocrine cell lineage resulted in the disruption of islet morphogenesis, including dysfunctional endocrine cell sorting, increased islet size, and failure of islets to migrate away from the ductal epithelium. We exploited the dysmorphic islets in pdx1PBHnf6 animals as a tool to identify factors important for islet morphogenesis. Genome-wide microarray analysis was used to identify differences in the gene expression profiles of late gestation and early postnatal pancreas tissue from wild type and pdx1PBHnf6 animals.

"We investigated age-related changes in the transcriptional profile of skeletal muscle in 5 month old (young) and 25 month old (old) C57BL/6NHsd mice using high density oligonucleotide arrays (22,690 transcripts probed). We identified 712 transcripts that are differentially expressed in young (5 month old) and old (25-month old) mouse skeletal muscle. Caloric restriction (CR) completely or partially reversed 87% of the changes in expression. Examination of individual genes revealed a transcriptional profile indicative of increased p53 activity in the older muscle. To determine whether the increase in p53 activity is associated with transcriptional activation of apoptotic targets, we performed RT-PCR on four well known mediators of p53-induced apoptosis: puma, noxa, tnfrsf10b and bok. Expression levels for these proapoptotic genes increased significantly with age (P<0.05), while CR significantly lowered expression levels for these genes as compared to control fed old mice (P<0.05). Age-related induction of p53-related genes was observed in multiple tissues, but was not observed in SOD2+/- and GPX4+/- mice, suggesting that oxidative stress does not mediate the observed age-related increase in expression. Western blot analysis confirmed that protein levels for both p21 and GADD45a, two established transcriptional targets of p53, were higher in the older muscle tissue. These observations support a role for p53-mediated apoptotic activity in mammalian aging. Experiment Overall Design: Animals were killed by cervical dislocation.

Animals had free access to tap water and food pellets (R36, Labfor, Stockholm, Sweden). Animals were randomly divided into healthy and diabetic groups. The diabetic group received a single peritoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, Sigma-Aldrich, France, 180 mg/kg) dissolved in sodium citrate buffer solution (0.1 mol/l, pH 4.5) to induce experimental diabetes similar to type 1. The other group received injection of an equal volume of buffer. Diabetes was confirmed 72 hours after the injection by urine glucose testing (Glukotest(r), Roche, Germany), and mice were characterized diabetic when urine glucose values were greater than 200 mg/dl. Diabetic and healthy animals were randomly assigned into 12 groups (n = 5 per group), which were sedentary or trained for one, three or five weeks. Training groups performed 1 hour per day of treadmill running at 21 m/min and 2.5 incline. After one day of familiarization on a rodent treadmill, the mice ran as described above 5 days per week. Mice were sacrificed 24 hours after the last training bout (respective sedentary controls at the same time) by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation.

Produced cDNA was then purified and transcribed in vitro to biotin labeled cRNA using Enzo Bioarray High Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). RNA was purified and its quality was checked. Purity and quantity of RNA was measured with Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Montchanin, DE) and integrity was tested with agarose gel electrophoresis. Sample was then fragmented and hybridized to Affymetrix test chip to check the function of the hybridization cocktail and to ensure adequate representation of both 5' and 3' ends of the RNA. After testing, samples (15 g) were hybridized to expression chips. After hybridization, chips were washed and stained in Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400. Arrays were stained first with R-Phycoerythrin Streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), then with biotinylated anti-streptavidin antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and again with R-Phycoerythrin Streptavidin for signal enhancement. The chip was scanned with GeneArray Scanner G2500A (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA); Scaling and normalization of data: The array images were analyzed with Microarray Suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) software. All chips were scaled (global scaling) to target intensity of 50 to minimize differences between chips caused by physical differences in chips, hybridization efficiencies and manual laboratory work. The data was subjected to robust normalization that reduces the errors, which are caused by binding capacity and linearity differences between probe sets."	"GEO"	"partial"		
"GSE4648"	"Transcription profiling of mouse heart after acute myocardial infarction vs sham operated and na ve controls to investigate gene expression changes at time points after AMI"	"We report a genome-wide survey of early responses of the mouse heart transcriptome to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). For three regions of the left ventricle (LV), namely ischemic/infarcted tissue (IF), the surviving LV free wall (FW) and the interventricular septum (IVS), 36,899 transcripts were assayed at six time points from 15 min to 48 h post-AMI in both AMI and sham surgery mice. For each transcript, temporal expression patterns were systematically compared between AMI and sham groups, which identified 515 AMI-responsive genes in IF tissue, 35 in the FW, 7 in the IVS, with three genes induced in all three regions. Using the literature, we assigned functional annotations to all 519 nonredundant AMI-induced genes and present two testable models for central signaling pathways induced early post-AMI. First, the early induction of 15 genes involved in assembly and activation of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors implicates AP-1 as a dominant regulator of earliest post-ischemic molecular events. Second, dramatic increases in transcripts for arginase 1 (ARG1), the enzymes of polyamine biosynthesis and protein inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity indicates that NO production may be regulated, in part, by inhibition of NOS and coordinate depletion of the NOS substrate, L-arginine. ARG1 was the single most highly induced transcript in the database (121-fold in IF region) and its induction in heart has not been previously reported. We report temporal and regional changes in steady state mRNA levels in the mouse LV following a surgically-induced AMI. Three regions of the infarcted LV were surveyed: IF, FW and IVS. For each region, mRNA levels were assayed at t=0 and six time points after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (t = 15 min, 1 h, 4 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h)."	"GEO"	"partial"

Our data indicate that the exon 1 mutant protein is present in the nucleus as part of an oligomeric or aggregation complex. Increasing the concentration of the mutant transprotein in the nucleus is sufficient for, and dramatically accelerates the onset and progression of behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, nuclear exon 1 mutant protein is sufficient to induce cytoplasmic neurodegeneration and transcriptional dysregulation. However, our data suggests that cytoplasmic mutant exon 1 htt, if present, contributes to disease progression. Five lines of transgenic mice and normal littermate controls were compared using Affymetrix MG-U74Av2 A arrays to examine gene expression in cerebellum. Each line had 3 or 4 replicates.

"Achieving a mechanistic understanding of disease and initiating preclinical therapeutic trials necessitate the study of huntingtin toxicity and its remedy in model systems. To allow the engagement of appropriate experimental paradigms, Huntington s disease (HD) models need to be validated in terms of how they recapitulate a particular aspect of human disease. In order to examine transcriptome-related effects of mutant huntingtin, we compared striatal mRNA profiles from seven genetic mouse models of disease to that of postmortem human HD caudate using microarray analysis. Transgenic models expressing short N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (R6/1 and R6/2 mice) exhibited the most rapid effects on gene expression, consistent with previous studies. Although changes in the brains of knock-in models of HD took longer to appear, 15-month and 22-month CHL2Q150/Q150, 18-month HdhQ92/Q92 and 2-year-old YAC128 animals also exhibited significant HD-like mRNA signatures. When the affected genes were compared across models, a robust concordance was observed. Importantly, changes concordant across multiple lines mice were also in excellent agreement with the mRNA changes seen in human HD caudate. Although it was expected that the expression of full-length huntingtin transprotein might result in unique gene expression changes compared to those caused by expression of an N-terminal huntingtin fragment, no discernable differences between full-length and fragment models were detected. There was, however, an overall concordance between transcriptomic signature and disease stage. We thus conclude that the transcriptional changes of HD can be modelled in several available lines of transgenic mice, comprising lines expressing both N-terminal and full-length mutant huntingtin proteins. The combined analysis of mouse and human HD transcriptomes provides an important chronology of mutant huntingtin's gene expression effects.

Elastic fibres are assembled through polymerization of tropoelastin monomers and loss of elastin is associated with aneurysmal degeneration of the aorta 2. The Fibulins are a six-member protein family hypothesized to function as intermolecular bridges that stabilize the organization of extracellular matrix structures such as elastic fibres and basement membranes 3. Fibulin-4 is found in the medial layers of arteries and moderately expressed in heart valves 4. To examine a potential role of Fibulin-4 in elastic fibre assembly and cardio-vascular disease we generated a mouse model underexpressing Fibulin-4. To get insight into the underlying molecular pathways involved in aneurysm formation, we determined the aorta transcriptome of Fibulin-4R/R animals and identified biological processes that were significantly overrepresented including apoptosis and cell death as well as several novel gene targets implicated in the response to aortic failure. We conclude that decreased Fibulin-4 expression causes aberrant composition of the elastin layers in the aorta and valvular leaflets, resulting in aortic aneurysms and heart abnormalities."

"GSE6383"	"Transcription profiling of mouse epithelium and mesenchyme to study the gene expression profiles in these two compartments"	"During organogenesis of the intestine, reciprocal crosstalk between the endodermally-derived epithelium and the underlying mesenchyme is required for regional patterning and proper differentiation. Though both of these tissue layers participate in patterning, the mesenchyme is thought to play a prominant role in the determination of epithelial phenotype during development and in adult life. However, the molecular basis of this instructional dominance is unclear. In fact, surprisingly little is known about the cellular origins of many of the critical signaling molecules and the gene transcriptional events that they impact. Here, we profile genes that are expressed in separated mesenchymal and epithelial compartments of the perinatal mouse intestine. The data indicate that the vast majority of soluble modulators of signaling pathways such as Hedgehog, Bmp, Wnt, Fgf and Igf are expressed predominantly or exclusively by the mesenchyme, accounting for its ability to dominate instructional crosstalk. We also catalog the most highly enriched transcription factors in both compartments and find evidence for a major role for Hnf4alpha and Hnf4 gamma in the regulation of epithelial genes. Finally, we find that while epithelially enriched genes tend to be highly tissue-restricted in their expression, mesenchymally-enriched genes tend to be broadly expressed in multiple tissues. Thus, the unique tissue-specific signature that characterizes the intestinal epithelium is instructed and supported by a mesenchyme that itself expresses genes that are largely non-tissue specific. Experiment Overall Design: Mouse small intestine (E18.5) is separated to epithelium and mesenchyme. Total RNA is extracted from epithelium and mesenchyme.

Background. The transcription factor Gata3 is critically involved in epidermis and hair follicle differentiation. Yet, little is known about how Gata3 co-ordinates stem cell lineage determination in skin, which processes are mostly implicated and how Gata3 differentially regulates distinct cell populations within the hair follicle. Here, we describe a conditional Gata3-/- mouse (K14-Gata3-/-) in which Gata3 is specifically deleted in epidermis and hair follicles. Principal findings. K14-Gata3-/- mice show aberrant postnatal growth and development, delayed hair growth and maintenance, abnormal hair follicle organization and irregular pigmentation. After the first hair cycle, the germinative layer surrounding the dermal papilla was not restored; instead, proliferation was pronounced in basal epidermal cells. Transcriptome analysis of laser-dissected K14-Gata3-/- hair follicles as compared to wild type littermate controls, revealed mitosis, epithelial differentiation and the Notch, WNT and BMP signalling pathways to comprise significantly overrepresented processes. Conclusions. Subsequent elucidation of these pathways at the RNA and protein levels and physiologic endpoints shows that Gata3 integrates diverse signalling networks to regulate the balance between hair follicle and epidermal cell fates."

"GSE2172"	"Transcription profiling of the mouse interleukin-10-deficient model for inflammatory bowel disease in C57Bl/6J and C3H/HeJBir strain backgrounds"	"Abstract: Interleukin-10-deficient (Il10-/-) mice serve as a model for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The severity of colitis strongly depends on the inbred strain carrying the disrupted Il10 gene: C3H/HeJBir (C3) confers disease susceptibility, whereas C57BL/6J (B6) confers resistance. Genome-wide scans with microsatellite markers on segregrating backcross and F2 populations resulted in the detection of ten colitogenic quantitative trait loci (QTL). The aim of this study was to reduce the large number of candidate genes within the QTL intervals by identifying those genes which are located within the candidate gene intervals and which are differentially expressed in the colon of IBD-susceptible and -resistant strains. Using this combination of QTL mapping and microarray analysis, we identified 16 genes which were differentially expressed between B6- and C3-Il10-/- mice and were located within the candidate gene intervals. Three of these genes (Pla2g2a, Gbp1, Cd14) showed prominent differences in expression levels between B6- and C3-Il10-/- as well as between B6 and C3 wildtype mice and were considered to be major candidate genes. Pla2g2a and Gbp1 are known to be polymorphic between C3 and B6 mice. Expression data for Cd14 were confirmed by real-time RT PCR using specified pathogen free and germfree Il10-/- mice. In conclusion, the large number of candidate genes was reduced to three major candidates by using a combination of QTL mapping and microarray analysis. All three genes play an important role in inflammatory processes and immune response. Material & Methods:; Two independent microarray experiments were performed using SPF mice: 19 for the first experiment (4 C3 WT [GSM39296], 5 C3-Il10-/- [GSM39297], 5 B6 WT [GSM39290], 5 B6-Il10-/- [GSM39291]) and 18 for the second (4 C3 WT [GSM39295], 4 C3-Il10-/- [GSM39294], 5 B6 WT [GSM39288], 5 B6-Il10-/- [GSM39289]). The mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Following a ventral midline incision, the colon (including the rectum, but not the anus) was removed and flushed with PBS. Each colon was opened longitudinally with a pair of scissors, further dissected and homogenized using a micropistill in 1.5 ml peqGOLD Trifast FL. RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer s protocol, and quality was checked using RNA Nano LabChip technology (Agilent, B blingen, Germany). For each of the two array experiments, equal amounts (7 micro gram) of RNA were pooled from the four or five animals of each mouse strain, resulting in a total of eight samples. For biotin-labeled target synthesis starting from 3-5 g of total RNA, reactions were performed using standard protocols supplied by the manufacturer (Affymetrix; Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 3-5 g total RNA were converted to dsDNA using 100 pmol of a T7T23V primer (Eurogentec; Seraing, Belgium) containing a T7 promoter. The cDNA was then used directly in an in-vitro transcription reaction in the presence of biotinylated nucleotides. The concentration of biotin-labeled cRNA was determined by UV absorbance. In all cases, 12.5 g of each biotinylated cRNA preparation were fragmented and placed in a hybridization cocktail containing four biotinylated hybridization controls (BioB, BioC, BioD, and Cre) as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were hybridized to an identical lot of Affymetrix MG U74Av2 for 16 hours. Data selection and transformation procedures. For normalization, all array experiments were scaled to a target intensity of 150, otherwise using the default values of the Microarray suite 5.0 (MAS 5.0). Filtering of the results was done as follows: Genes were considered as strong regulated if their fold change was greater than or equal 2 or less than or equal -2, the statistical parameter for a significant change was less than 0.01 (change p-Value for changes called Increased) or greater than 0.99 (change p-Value for changes called Decreased). Additionally, the signal difference of a certain gene was greater than 200. Genes were considered as weak regulated if their fold change was greater than or equal 1.5 or less than or equal -1.5, the statistical parameter for a significant change was less than 0.001 or greater than 0.999 and the signal difference of a certain gene was greater than 40."

"Background: Progressive neurological dysfunction is a key aspect of human aging. Because of underlying differences in the aging of mice and humans, useful mouse models have been difficult to obtain and study. We have used gene-expression analysis and polymorphism screening to study molecular senescence of the retina and hippocampus in two rare inbred mouse models of accelerated neurological senescence (SAMP8 and SAMP10) that closely mimic human neurological aging, and in a related normal strain (SAMR1) and an unrelated normal strain (C57BL/6J). Results: The majority of age-related gene expression changes were strain-specific, with only a few common pathways found for normal and accelerated neurological aging. Polymorphism screening led to the identification of mutations that could have a direct impact on important disease processes, including a mutation in a fibroblast growth factor gene, Fgf1, and a mutation in and ectopic expression of the gene for the chemokine CCL19, which is involved in the inflammatory response. Conclusions: We show that combining the study of inbred mouse strains with interesting traits and gene-expression profiling can lead to the discovery of genes important for complex phenotypes. Furthermore, full-genome polymorphism detection, sequencing and gene-expression profiling of inbred mouse strains with interesting phenotypic differences may provide unique insights into the molecular genetics of late-manifesting complex diseases. Experiment Overall Design: Gene-expression profiling was performed on 3 month-old (young), 16 month-old (old) S8, S10 and SR1 mice. Two independent samples for each time point were used in gene-expression profiling for each strain. Because of greater replicate variability, three samples were used for hippocampus of 16-month SAM mice. A 10.0 ug sample of total RNA was used to generate labeled cRNA for each sample according to recommended protocols (Affymetrix). RNA from multiple animals was not pooled, except in the case of retina, where the retinas of two mice were combined to generate sufficient total RNA."	"GEO"	"partial"

Adequate maternal-fetal transport of folate is necessary for normal embryogenesis. Targeted inactivation of the murine RFC1 gene results in post-implantation embryo lethality, but daily folic acid supplementation of pregnant dams prolongs survival of homozygous embryos until mid-gestation. At E10.5 RFC1-/- embryos are developmentally delayed relative to wildtype littermates, have multiple malformations, including neural tube defects, and die due to failure of chorioallantoic fusion. The mesoderm is sparse and disorganized, and there is a marked absence of erythrocytes in yolk sac blood islands. Affymetrix microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR validation of the relative gene expression profiles in E9.5 RFC1-/- vs. RFC1+/+ embryos indicates a dramatic downregulation of multiple genes involved in erythropoiesis, and upregulation of several genes that form the cubilin-megalin multiligand endocytic receptor complex. Megalin protein expression disappears from the visceral yolk sac of RFC1-/- embryos, and cubilin protein is widely misexpressed. Inactivation of RFC1 impacts the expression of several ligands and interacting proteins in the cubilin-amnionless-megalin complex that are involved in the maternal-fetal transport of folate, vitamin B12, and other nutrients, lipids and morphogens required for normal embryogenesis.

However, not all obese patients have the same risk of developing these disorders. Individuals with peripheral obesity, i.e., fat distributed subcutaneously, are at little or no risk of the common medical complications of obesity, whereas individuals with central obesity, i.e., fat accumulated in visceral depots, are prone to these complications. In the present study, using microaarays gene expression, we have explored the hypothesis that patterns of fat distribution and, perhaps, to some degree, obesity itself may have a developmental genetic origin.

"GSE640"	"Transcription profiling of mouse testises at different developmental stages and cultures enriched in mouse Sertoli or interstitial cells to identify genes expressed differentially in meiotic or postmeiotic spermatogenic cells."	"A multitude of genes expressed solely in meiotic or postmeiotic spermatogenic cells offers a myriad of contraceptive targets. Understanding mammalian spermatozoan development and the events surrounding fertilization has grown slowly, in part because of uncertainty about the number and identity of the cellular components involved. Determination of those transcripts expressed specifically by germ cells should provide an inclusive list of probable critical proteins. Here, total mouse testis transcript profiles were trimmed of transcripts found in cultures enriched in Sertoli or interstitial cells to yield a germ cell-enriched transcript profile. Monitoring of changes of this profile in the developing testis identified 1,652 genes whose transcript abundance increased markedly coincident with the onset of meiosis. Remarkably, 351 of these genes ( approximately 20%) appear to be expressed only in the male germline. Germ cell-specific transcripts are much less common earlier in testis development. Further analysis of the UniGene EST database coupled with quantitative PCR indicates that approximately 4% of the mouse genome is dedicated to expression in postmeiotic male germ cells. Most or many of the protein products of these transcripts are probably retained in mature spermatozoa. Targeted disruption of 19 of these genes has indicated that a majority have roles critical for normal fertility. Thus, we find an astonishing number of genes expressed specifically by male germ cells late in development. This extensive group provides a plethora of potential targets for germ cell-directed contraception and a staggering number of candidate proteins that could be critical for fertilization."

"The current model to explain the organization of the mammalian nervous system is based on studies of anatomy, embryology, and evolution. To further investigate the molecular organization of the adult mammalian brain, we have built a gene expression-based brain map. We measured gene expression patterns for 24 neural tissues covering the mouse central nervous system and found, surprisingly, that the adult brain bears a transcriptional imprint consistent with both embryological origins and classic evolutionary relationships. Embryonic cellular position along the anterior-posterior axis of the neural tube was shown to be closely associated with, and possibly a determinant of, the gene expression patterns in adult structures. We also observed a significant number of embryonic patterning and homeobox genes with region-specific expression in the adult nervous system. The relationships between global expression patterns for different anatomical regions and the nature of the observed region-specific genes suggest that the adult brain retains a degree of overall gene expression established during embryogenesis that is important for regional specificity and the functional relationships between regions in the adult. The complete collection of extensively annotated gene expression data along with data mining and visualization tools have been made available on a publicly accessible web site (www.barlow-lockhartbrainmapnimhgrant.org).

To help understand how smoking modifies small airway structure and function, we developed a strategy using fiberoptic bronchoscopy and brushing to sample the human small airway (10th-12th order) bronchial epithelium to assess gene expression (Affymetrix HG-U133A array) in phenotypically normal smokers (n=6, 24 4 pack-yr) compared to matched non-smokers (n=5). Compared to samples from the large (2nd to 3rd order) bronchi, the small airway samples had a higher proportion of ciliated cells, but less basal, undifferentiated, and secretory cells. The small, but not large, airway samples included Clara cells, a cell found only in the small airway epithelium, and the small, but not the large, airway epithelium expressed genes for the surfactant apoproteins. Despite the fact that the smokers were phenotypically normal, analysis of the small airway epithelium of the smokers compared to the non-smokers demonstrated up- and -down-regulation of genes in multiple categories relevant to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), including genes coding for cytokines/innate immunity, apoptosis, pro-fibrosis, mucin, responses to oxidants and xenobiotics, antiproteases and general cellular processes. In the context that COPD starts in the small airways, these changes in gene expression in the small airway epithelium in phenotypically normal smokers are candidates for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent the onset of COPD.

We have used an expression microarray approach for studying differences in global gene expression pattern caused by mutations in FH. Seven uterine fibroids carrying FH mutations were compared with 15 fibroids with wild-type FH. The two groups showed markedly different expression profiles, and multiple differentially expressed genes were detected. The most significant increase in FH mutants was seen in the expression of carbohydrate metabolism- and glycolysis-related genes. Other significantly up-regulated gene categories in FH mutants were, for example, iron ion homeostasis and oxidoreduction. Genes with lower expression in FH-mutant fibroids belonged to groups such as extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, muscle development and cell contraction.

"GSE3489"	"Transcription profiling of human brain samples from HIV infected individuals with HIV encephalitis vs controls"	"The neurodegenerative process in HIV encephalitis (HIVE) is associated with extensive damage to the dendritic and synaptic structure that often leads to cognitive impairment. Several mechanisms might be at play, including release of neurotoxins, oxidative stress and decreased activity of neurotrophic factors. Furthermore, HIV-mediated dysregulation of genes involved in neuronal maintenance might play an important role. For this purpose, cRNA was prepared from the brains of 17 AIDS patients for analysis with the Affymetrix Human U95Av2 GeneChip and analyzed with the GeneSpring Expression Analysis Software. Out of 12,625 genes analyzed, 74 were downregulated and 59 were upregulated compared to controls. Initial alternative analysis of RNA was performed by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA). In cases with HIVE, downregulated genes included neuronal molecules involved in synaptic plasticity and transmission (ion channels, synaptogyrin, synapsin II), cell cycle (p35, p39, CDC-L2, CDC42, PAK1) and signaling molecules (PI3K, Ras-Raf-MEK1), transcription factors and cytoskeletal components (MAP-1B, MAP-2, tubulin, adducin-2). Upregulated genes included those involved in neuroimmune (IgG, MHC, ?2microglobulin) and anti-viral responses (interferon-inducible molecules), transcription (STAT1, OLIG2, Pax-6) and signaling modulation (MEK3, EphB1) of the cytoskeleton (myosin, aduccin-3, radixin, dystrobrevin). Taken together, this study suggests that HIV proteins released from infected macrophages might not only induce a neuroinflammatory response, but also may promote neurodegeneration by interfering with neuronal transcription of genes involved in regulating signaling and cytoskeletal molecules important in maintaining synapto-dendritic functioning and integrity. RNA was obtained from brain slabs that are rapidly frozen after removal and stored at ?80 C for subsequent molecular and biochemical analysis. From each case, a frontal cortex (Broadmann area 46) block (1 mm3) was dissected from the frozen brain slabs. The underlying white matter was dissected out with a blade, thus most of the RNA obtained is isolated from a sample of gray matter. Total RNA (approximately 50 ?g) was purified from 250 mg of this frozen tissue block with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol, with an additional centrifugation step to remove unwanted cellular debris. RNA was then further purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the quantity of total RNA was assessed by 260-nm UV absorption, with quality analyzed by gel electrophoresis and analysis of the ribosomal RNA bands. This analysis confirmed that in the samples included for this study, the 18S and 28S bands were clearly identified, indicating that the RNA was well preserved (Fig. 1). For the protocol, 10 ?g of total RNA was utilized per experiment. This was prepared to synthesize cDNA that was then used as a template to produce biotinylated cRNA. Affymetrix Test 2 chips were used to assess RNA quality by examining the 3? to 5? ratios for actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). A total of 15 ?g cRNA was prepared in a hybridization cocktail of 300 ml total volume, of which 200 ?l was placed on an Affymetrix Human U95Av2 GeneChip, containing 12,625 independent probe sets to analyze gene expression. After hybridization, this sample was returned to the original aliquot, which was then frozen. For the frontal lobe samples, a further 200 ?l was sampled from the original cocktail and hybridized to a separate duplicate GeneChip within 30 days. Hybridization and subsequent washing and staining were carried out using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400 following supplied protocols. Chips were then double stained and scanned according to basic Affymetrix protocol to create GeneChip image files that were converted to text-bases files using Microarray Suite 5.0 software (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).

"GSE2634"	"Transcription profiling of blood from humans, rhesus macaque, cynomolous macaque and the African green monkey to compare human and non-human primates gene expression profiles using a human genechip"	"Gene expression profiling is an important tool in the development of medical countermeasures against chemical warfare agents (CWAs). Non-human primates (NHPs), specifically the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), the cynomologus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and the African green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops), are vital models in the development of CWA prophylactics, therapeutics, and diagnostics. However, gene expression profiling of these NHPs is complicated by the fact their genomes are not completely sequenced, and that no commercially available oligonucleotide microarrays (genechips) exist. We, therefore, sought to determine whether gene expression profiling of NHPs could be performed using human genechips. Whole blood RNA was isolated from each species and used to generate genechip probes. Hybridization of the NHP samples to human genechips (Affymetrix Human U133 Plus 2.0) resulted in comparable numbers of transcripts detected compared with human samples. Statistical analysis revealed intraspecies reproducibility of genechip quality control metrics; interspecies comparison between NHPs and humans showed little significant difference in the quality and reproducibility of data generated using human genechips. Expression profiles of each species were compared using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering to determine the similarity of the expression profiles within and across the species. The cynomologus group showed the least intraspecies variability, while the human group showed the greatest intraspecies variability. Intraspecies comparison of the expression profiles identified probesets that were reproducibly detected within each species. Each NHP species was found to be dissimilar to humans; the cynomologus group was the most dissimilar. Interspecies comparison of the expression profiles revealed probesets that were reproducibly detected in all species examined. These results show that human genechips can be used for expression profiling of NHP samples and provide a foundation for the development of tools for comparing human and NHP gene expression profiles."

"GSE10072"	"Transcription profiling of human lung adenocarcinoma and non-tumors from former, current and never smoking individuals"	"Tobacco smoking is responsible for over 90% of lung cancer cases, and yet the precise molecular alterations induced by smoking in lung that develop into cancer and impact survival have remained obscure. We performed gene expression analysis using HG-U133A Affymetrix chips on 135 fresh frozen tissue samples of adenocarcinoma and paired noninvolved lung tissue from current, former and never smokers, with biochemically validated smoking information. ANOVA analysis adjusted for potential confounders, multiple testing procedure, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, and GO-functional classification were conducted for gene selection. Results were confirmed in independent adenocarcinoma and non-tumor tissues from two studies. We identified a gene expression signature characteristic of smoking that includes cell cycle genes, particularly those involved in the mitotic spindle formation (e.g., NEK2, TTK, PRC1). Expression of these genes strongly differentiated both smokers from non-smokers in lung tumors and early stage tumor tissue from non-tumor tissue (p<0.001 and fold-change>1.5, for each comparison), consistent with an important role for this pathway in lung carcinogenesis induced by smoking. These changes persisted many years after smoking cessation. NEK2 (p<0.001) and TTK (p=0.002) expression in the noninvolved lung tissue was also associated with a 3-fold increased risk of mortality from lung adenocarcinoma in smokers. Our work provides insight into the smoking-related mechanisms of lung neoplasia, and shows that the very mitotic genes known to be involved in cancer development are induced by smoking and affect survival. These genes are candidate targets for chemoprevention and treatment of lung cancer in smokers. Experiment Overall Design: Overall, 180 adenocarcinoma and non-tumor tissue samples were selected for the analyses, including duplicate or triplicate samples from 14 subjects for quality control. From the original 180 samples, 148 provided sufficient quantity of high-quality RNA for microarray analyses; 13 additional samples were excluded because of problematic assays. Normalization was conducted on the remaining 135 microarrays. After normalization, 13 samples were excluded because of low percentage of tumor cells in the tumor tissues.

Previously, we reported that differential promoter context and cofactor recruitment contribute to the tissue specificity of tamoxifen. Here, we investigated the genomic basis for the partial oestrogenic activity of tamoxifen in the endometrium. We showed that tamoxifen not only affects the rate of transcription of oestrogen target genes but also targets a unique set of genes. Since oestrogen and tamoxifen are both able to bind to oestrogen receptors (ERs) and because both promote endometrial carcinogenesis, we hypothesized that the molecular effectors for ERs in endometrial carcinogenesis most likely reside in genes that are commonly targeted by oestrogen and tamoxifen. Among those target genes, we identified a paired-box gene PAX2 that is critically involved in cell proliferation and carcinogenesis in the endometrium. Our experiments also demonstrated that PAX2 is activated by oestrogen and tamoxifen in endometrial carcinomas but not in normal endometrium, and this activation is associated with cancer-linked hypomethylation of the PAX2 promoter.

Ketogenic diets may alter physiologic and metabolic profiles in a direction that favors weight loss. C57BL/6J mice were maintained for six weeks on either chow or ketogenic diet. Mice eating KD had lower weights, 90% reduction in insulin levels and increased energy expenditure compared to animals fed chow. Despite consumption of a very high fat diet serum lipids remained normal. Here we show that consumption of KD shifted liver metabolism to drastically increased fatty acid oxidation. Concurrently, expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis were markedly suppressed. Reference: A high fat, ketogenic diet induces a unique metabolic state in mice.

"Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is a component of milk and other external secretions. Recently, we found antiinflammatory effect of orally administered LPO in mouse model of influenza virus-induced pneumonia. In order to study influence of bovine LPO on the digestive tract as its possible target organ, we performed comprehensive gene expression analysis of the mouse small intestine using GeneChip microarray to compare the effect of LPO with that of water or bovine serum albumin (BSA). We observed that 3 h after single ingestion of LPO the levels of 78 gene expression are upregulated and those of 9 gene expressions are downregulated. Within most changed genes, 5 upregulated and 1 downregulated genes such as FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) and serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase (SGK) are known to be transcriptionally modulated by glucocorticoid. This result suggests that ingested LPO modulates gene expressions in the small intestine in a glucocorticoid-like manner and this activity may link to its systemic antiinflammatory effects. Experiment Overall Design: Mice were orally administered 200 microL of water (n=3), bovine serum albumin (BSA, 2.5 g/kg body weight, n=3), or bovine lactoperoxidase (LPO, 2.5 g/kg body weight, n=3).

"GSE2869"	"Transcription profiling of HIPK2 dominant negative mouse mutants vs wild type littermates to identify genes regulated by HIPK2 which are likely to be involved in axon pathfinding"	"Using targeted gene deletion, we have firmly established that the Class IV POU domain transcription factor Brn-3.2 controls a developmental program regulating axon pathfinding in the mouse visual system. We have isolated and identified downstream gene targets of Brn-3.2, using Representational Difference Analysis (RDA), on cDNA populations derived from wildtype and Brn-3.2-/- retina at the appropriate embryonic stage. One of these candidate genes, the Homeodomain Interacting Protein Kinase 2 (HIPK2), is postulated to be a transcriptional coregulator, based on its in vitro interactions with repressor homeodomain proteins of the NK class, as well as other components of repressor complexes. HIPK2 has also been shown to be involved in post-translational modification of two major transcriptional regulators, p53 and CtBP. Expression of a dominant-negative form of HIPK2 in sensory neurons affects the innervation patterns of their target tissues, suggesting an axon pathfinding defect.,The aim of this project is to identify targets for the Homeodomain Interacting Protein Kinase 2 (HIPK2), that we isolated as a downstream gene target of the class IV POU domain transcription factor Brn-3.2, and to investigate their function in the Brn-3.2 dependent pathway regulating axon pathfinding. ,We hypothesize that the genes regulated by HIPK2 will play a critical role in axon pathfinding and that the results of this study will provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of axon pathfinding, and possibly neural plasticity and regeneration, and therefore, be of great interest to the field of neurobiology in general.,In order to uncover potential biological role(s) of HIPK2 in neural development, and particularly axon pathfinding, we generated transgenic mouse models for in vivo studies. Our preliminary observations in transgenic mice, indicate that a form of the molecule expected to act as a dominant-negative and designed to be expressed in sensory neurons, affects the innervation patterns of their target tissues, suggesting an axon pathfinding defect. We plan to take advantage of this model to identify genes regulated by HIPK2, and which are likely to be involved in axon pathfinding. To this end, we will compare gene expression profiles in sensory neurons isolated wild-type and transgenic mice. In our experimental paradigm, the trigeminal ganglion represents the ideal sensory structure in which to perform such an analysis: 1) High levels of transgene can be expressed in the trigeminal ganglion, as assessed by the expression of LacZ from the bicistronic construct which contains IRES-LacZ downstream of a dominant negative form of HIPK2. 2) The trigeminal ganglion can be dissected at embryonic day 13.5, when the phenotype is apparent, with ease and free of contamination from surrounding tissues. 3) The amounts of RNA that can be isolated from a single ganglion are in the range of 200-300 ng, which should be sufficient for microarray analysis following linear amplification of RNA. One series will be carried out with transgenic embryos and a control series will be carried out with wildtype littermates. Animals will be prepared and sacrificed by a standard protocol. Tissue will be rapidly dissected from E13.5 trigeminal ganglion, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80C until RNA is extracted. RNA will be prepared using RNeasy Micro Kit. We will be providing 4 tissue samples for each of the wildtype and transgenic animals to mitigate any expression differences resulting from mouse to mouse variation."	"GEO"	"partial"

"Transcription factor paralogs may share a common role (e.g. Hox) in staged or overlapping expression in specific tissues. In other examples, members have distinct roles in a range of embryologic, differentiation or response pathways (e.g. Tbx, Pax). For the Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) family of transcription factors, mice deficient in Irf1, Irf2, Irf3, Irf4, Irf5, Irf7, Irf8 or Irf9, have defects in the immune response but display no embryologic abnormalities. Mice deficient for Irf6 have not been reported, but in humans, mutations in IRF6 cause two Mendelian orofacial clefting syndrome, and genetic variation in IRF6 confers risk for isolated cleft lip and palate. Mice deficient for Irf6 have abnormal skin, limb and craniofacial development. Histological and gene expression analyses indicate that the primary defect is in keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation.

The protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulates neuronal proteins by mediating their de-phosphorylation. PP1 selectivity and subcellular localization is conferred via association with a panel of interacting proteins. We have extensively characterized the association of PP1 with inhibitor-1, an interacting protein widely expressed in brain and heart. Inhibitor-1 deletion results in a persistently active PP1 phosphatase in vitro. Inhibitor-1 overexpression results in increased transformation of cultured cells and enhances the rate of learning and memory in mouse models through largely unknown mechanisms. Significantly, inhibitor-1 activation is cAMP-sensitive. The genes regulated by inhibitor-1/PP1 signals have not been characterized. Identification of these genes is expected to provide key insights into the role of inhibitor-1/PP1 escape from cellular homeostasis and regulation of neuronal learning and memory.,We will determine gene expression patterns in hippocampus of wild-type and inhibitor-1 knock-out mice.

Using microarrays, we characterized global changes in gene expression and used Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) to identify biological and molecular processes that accompany and likely underlie these transitions. The analysis confirmed previously described processes or events, but more important, EASE revealed new insights. Response to DNA damage and DNA repair genes are overrepresented in the oocyte compared to 1-cell through blastocyst stages and may reflect the oocyte's response to selective pressures to insure genomic integrity; fertilization results in changes in the transcript profile in the 1-cell embryo that are far greater than previously recognized; and genome activation during 2-cell stage may not be as global and promiscuous as previously proposed, but rather far more selective, with genes involved in transcription and RNA processing being preferentially expressed. These results validate this hypothesis-generating approach by identifying genes involved in critical biological processes that can be the subject of a more traditional hypothesis-driven approach."

Patients suffering from SSADH deficiency experience language acquisition failure, memory deficiencies, autism, increased aggressive behaviors, and seizures. There is a chemical buildup of both gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) in the neurological system of these patients. The Aldh5a1-/- knock out mouse model of SSADH deficiency shows the same chemical imbalances as the human disease, with additional fatal tonic-clonic seizures at three weeks of age. The elucidation of seizure causing pathways will facilitate treatment of seizure phenotypes in diseases with related epilepsy. ,Gene expression patterns within the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex of SSADH deficient mice (Aldh5a1-/- mice) will be compared to wild type mice at a time point immediately prior to fatal seizures. ,We hypothesis that the SSADH deficient mice experience a dysfunction of glutamate/GABA/ glutamine neurotransmitter cycle linked to astroglial metabolism and/or uptake of neuronally-released glutamate. The increased levels of GHB and GABA lead to down regulation of GABA-B-Receptor leading to seizures. The SSADH deficient phenotype may also be caused by ongoing oxidative damage and the pathological role of succinic semialdehyde.,SSADH deficient mice (Aldh5a1-/- knock out) exhibit fatal seizures around three weeks of age.

MD partially activates homeostatic mechanisms but differentially upregulates gene systems related to growth factors and neuronal degeneration, consistent with reorganization of connections after MD.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the oculomotor neurons are intrinsically protected in ALS. Using high-density cDNA microarrays, we examined the transcriptome of oculomotor nuclei and spinal cords in mice expressing a human mutant SOD1, the SOD1(G93A) ALS model, at 6 and 10 weeks of age. Comparison of gene expression profiles of these pre-symptomatic SOD1(G93A) mice showed a shift to a proapoptotic state in spinal cords, while the opposite was true in oculomotor nuclei. Seventeen members of the A, B, C and D Hox clusters increased in oculomotor nuclei from 6 to 10 weeks of age; 15 were downregulated in spinal cord. Although only the first 4 classes of a given Hox cluster (e.g., Hoxa1-4) are normally expressed in the developing hindbrain, we found differential expression of mostly the latter classes in both oculomotor nuclei and spinal cords. Also, semaphorin 3B was expressed at 28-fold greater levels in oculomotor nuclei and 61-fold less in spinal cords in 10-week old SOD1(G93A) mice compared to 6-week old mice. Semaphorins 3A and 3E were also differentially regulated. Comparison of gene expression profiles of control SOD1 mice of 6 and 10 weeks of age did not show these changes. Based on these results, we rejected our hypothesis and conclude that the oculomotor nuclei actively adapt to the ALS-inducing mutation.,Supported by NEI and ALSA. Overall design: Oligonucleotide microarray studies using the Affymetrix system were conducted as described earlier (McMullen et al., 2004). Biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Expression Set 430A GeneChips. Then, the microarrays were washed and stained with a streptavidin-bound marker, and scanned with a laser scanner. Resulting microarray data were analyzed with Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software. Only those genes with consistent absent/present calls in the three independent replicates per group were considered for further analyses. Comparisons were crossed such that each oculomotor nuclei sample was compared with each spinal cord sample at the corresponding age. The Affymetrix software uses the one-sided Wilcoxon s signed rank test to estimate increase/no change/decrease difference calls and fold-changes for each pair-wise comparison. Only difference calls consistent in all pair-wise comparisons and with average changes greater than 2-fold were considered significant, resulting in a conservative list of genes with changed expression levels."

To define GK's role in insulin resistance, we examined gene expression in brown adipose tissue in a glycerol kinase (Gyk) knockout (KO) mouse model using microarray analysis. Global gene expression profiles of KO mice were distinct from wild type (WT) with 668 genes that were differentially expressed. These included genes involved in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, insulin signaling, and insulin resistance. Real-Time (RT) PCR analysis confirmed the differential expression of selected genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. PathwayAssist analysis confirmed direct and indirect connections between GK and genes in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, insulin signaling, and insulin resistance. Network Component Analysis (NCA) showed that the transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR- ), sterol regulatory element binding factor 1 (SREBP-1), SREBP-2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), STAT5, trans-acting transcription factor 1 (SP1), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBP- ), cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and PPAR- have altered activity in the KO mice.

"Mice were subjected to 50 eccentric contractions (EC) or 50 isometric contractions (IC) using a non-invasive model, and then sacrificed 48 hours later. RNA from the tibialis anterior of 4 animals were pooled and then split into two groups for hybridization onto two separate Affymetrix MGU74Av2 chips. Control samples were contralateral to the exercised legs, and were only subjected to enough contractions to measure isometric torque. Eccentric contractions (ECs), in which a muscle is forced to lengthen while activated, result in muscle injury and, eventually, muscle strengthening and prevention of further injury. Although the mechanical basis of eccentric contraction-induced injury has been studied in detail, muscle's biological response is less well characterized. This study presents the development of a minimally-invasive model of EC injury in the mouse, follows the time course of torque recovery after an injurious bout of ECs, and uses Affymetrix microarrays to compare the gene expression profile 48 hours after ECs to both isometrically stimulated muscles and contralateral muscles. Torque dropped by about 55% immediately after the exercise bout, and recovered to initial levels 7 days later. 36 known genes were upregulated after ECs compared to contralateral and isometrically stimulated muscles, including five muscle specific genes: muscle LIM protein (MLP), Muscle Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (MARP 1 and 2; also known as cardiac ankyrin repeat protein and Arpp/Ankrd2, respectively), Xin, and Myosin Binding Protein H. The time courses of MLP and MARP expression after the injury bout (determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) indicate that these genes are rapidly induced, reaching a peak expression level of 6-11 times contralateral values 12-24 hours after the EC bout and returning to baseline within 72 hours. Very little gene induction was seen after either isometric activation or passive stretch, indicating that the MLP and MARP genes may play an important and specific role in the biological response of muscle to EC-induced injury.

"GSE3565"	"Transcription profiling of spleens from dual specificity phosphatase-1 (DUSP1) deficient and wild type mice to demonstrate a specific regulatory role of DUSP1 on a subset of LPS-induced genes that control the outcome of endotoxin shock."	"Activation of the Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade following Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation enables innate immune cells to rapidly activate cytokine gene expression. A balanced response to signals of infectious danger requires that cellular activation is transient. Here, we identify the MAPK phosphatase Dual specificity phosphatase-1 (DUSP1) as an essential endogenous regulator of the inflammatory response to LPS. DUSP1-deficient (DUSP1-/-) bone marrow derived macrophages showed selectively prolonged activation of p38 MAPK and increased cytokine production. Intraperitoneal challenge of DUSP1-/- mice with LPS caused increased lethality and overshooting production of IL-6 and TNF. Transcriptional profiling revealed that DUSP1 controls a significant fraction of LPS-induced genes, that includes IL-6 and IL-10 as well as the chemokines CCL3, CCL4 and CXCL2. In contrast, the expression of the important mediators of endotoxin lethality, IFN? and IL-12, was not significantly altered by the absence of DUSP1. These data together demonstrate a specific regulatory role of DUSP1 in controlling a subset of LPS-induced genes that determines the outcome of endotoxin shock. Experiment Overall Design: Mice were injected intraperitoneally with E. coli LPS (10 g/g bodyweight) and sacrificed 6h later. Total spleen RNA (5 g) was prepared, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix MOE430A 2.0 GeneChips according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three biological replicates per condition were analysed.

"GSE528"	"Transcription profiling of hearts from Nkx2.5 knockout mice (mouse model of congenital heart disease) at embryonic day 12.5 shows Nkx2.5 is not only crucial during early steps of cardiogenesis but also plays an important role at later developmental stages"	"The NK2 family of homeobox genes constitutes a family of transcription factors that play an important role in different developmental processes. Members of this group are characterized by two highly conserved protein domains: the homeodomain, conferring DNA binding activity, and the NK2-specific domain (NK2-SD) of yet unknown function. One of the best characterized members of this group is the early cardiogenic marker Nkx2.5. Loss of function of Nkx2.5 leads to embryonic lethality around E10.5 due to an arrest of heart development at the looping stage. We have further dissected the function of Nkx2.5 in vivo by creating a knockout mouse line harboring an in frame deletion of the NK2-SD by Cre/loxP mediated excision. Homozygous mutant mice die at E14.5 due to severe cardiac malformations, e.g. common AV canal, DORV, and VSD. Lack of the NK2-SD leads to downregulation of the ventricular markers MLC-2v and Irx4 specifically in the right ventricle, and is accompanied with reduced right ventricular function. This function of Nkx2.5 seems to be independent of its ability to bind target DNA, since lack of the NK2-SD does not alter the DNA binding activity of Csx/Nkx2.5 in vitro. Heterozygous mutant mice show a spectrum of cardiac defects related to cardiac septation and valve morphogenesis, but lack conduction system defects as reported for heterozygous Nkx2.5 mice. The phenotype observed in NK2-SD mutant mice shows that Nkx2.5 is not only crucial during early steps of cardiogenesis but also plays an important role at later developmental stages. Embryos were isolated at embryonic day 12.5. The entire embryo heart was taken and isolated in ice-cold PBS and immediately frozen on dry-ice. Total RNA was extracted from pooled samples of wildtype, heterozygous and mutant embryos."	"GEO"	"partial"	"http://cardiogenomics.med.harvard.edu/groups/proj1/pages/nk2-sd_home.html"

Tumors occur in the absence of p53 mutations and in the presence of a seemingly functional p53 signaling pathway. At 16 weeks of age, no histological evidence of tumors is observed in these transgenic mammary glands; however, mammary cells do demonstrate centrosome amplification at this age suggesting that early tumorigenic processes may have occured. Thus comparison of the transcriptome of the mammary glands from 16 week old LH-overexpressing mice to that of wild type mice will provide insight into early events occuring in p53-independent hormone-induced tumorigenesis.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type1 is one such disease, caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the novel protein ataxin-1. To faithfully model SCA1 in the mouse, we generated knock-in mice carrying 154 CAG repeats in the mouse Sca1 locus. These mice reproduced many aspects of the human disease. Despite ubiquitous expression of the mutant protein, they developed slowly progressive selective neurodegeneration , which is most distinct in Purkinje cells and spinal cord. Alterations in gene expression have been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of polyglutamine disease including SCA1, but the changes of gene expression in an authentic disease model have not been characterized. We believe that knowledge of these genes will give insight into the pathophysiology of SCA1 and may ultimately be relevant to the treatment of SCA1.,We will determine gene expression patterns in the cerebellum and forebrain at three different time points.,We propose that the genes whose expression is affected by mutant ataxin-1 expression are effectors for neuronal dysfunction and neuronal degeneration in the knock-in mice. We also hypothesize the difference in the expression levels of these genes accounts for selective vulnerability of neurons.,We will examine three time points: 4 weeks, 11 weeks, and 20 weeks of age. We have shown that the mice developed motor incoordination as revealed by rotating rod test as early as 5 weeks of age but it was not until 10 weeks that they start showing clear neurological phenotype such as clasping. At each point, we will compare the pattern between the mutant and wild-type littermate. Animals will be prepared and sacrificed by a standard procedure. Cerebellum and spinal cord are the most affected areas whereas forebrain shows less neurodegeneration. Tissue will be rapidly dissected from cerebellum and forebrain, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at ?80 C until analysis. Tissues will be sent to the centers (as opposed to RNA). We will be providing 9 tissue samples from three litters for each time point to mitigate any expression differences resulting from subtle differences of procedure or environment where the mice grow."

It has been suggested that MTf is involved in a variety of processes such as Fe metabolism and cellular differentiation. Considering the crucial role of Fe in many metabolic pathways e.g., DNA synthesis, it is important to understand the function of MTf. To define the roles of MTf, a MTf knockout (MTf -/-) mouse model was developed. Examination of the MTf -/- mice demonstrated no phenotypic differences compared to wild-type littermates. However, microarray analysis showed differential expression of molecules involved in proliferation such as Mef2a, Tcf4, Gls and Apod in MTf -/- mice compared to MTf +/+ littermates, suggesting a role for MTf in proliferation and tumorigenesis."

"GSE3843"	"Transcription profiling of liver from wild type vs glycerol kinase knockout mice to understand the molecular pathogenesis of GKD"	"Glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) is an X-linked inborn error of metabolism with metabolic and neurologic crises. Liver shows the highest level of glycerol kinase (GK) activity in humans and mice. Absence of genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with GKD indicate the involvement of modifier genes, including other network partners. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of GKD, we performed microarray analysis on liver mRNA from neonatal glycerol kinase (Gyk) knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice. Unsupervised learning revealed the overall gene expression profile of the KO mice was different from that of WT. Real time PCR confirmed differences for selected genes. Functional gene enrichment analysis was used to find 56 increased and 37 decreased gene functional categories. Pathway Assist analysis identified changes in gene expression levels of genes involved in organic acid metabolism indicating that GK was part of the same metabolic network which correlates well with the patients with GKD having metabolic acidemia during their episodic crises. Network component analysis (NCA) showed that transcription factors SREBP-1c, ChREBP, HNF-4alpha, and PPAR-alpha, had increased activity in the Gyk KO mice compared with WT mice; while SREBP-2 was less active in the Gyk KO mice. These studies show that Gyk deletion causes alterations in gene expression of genes in several regulatory networks and is the first time NCA has been used to expand on microarray data from a mouse knockout model of a human disease. Male WT and KO mouse pups were sacrificed on day of life (dol) 3 and each liver was harvested. Total RNA from 4 KO and 4 WT livers was isolated individually. cDNA was synthesized from the poly(A)+ mRNA in the total RNA, Biotin-tagged and fragmented to an average strand length of 100 bases (range 35-200 bases). Ten g of each cRNA was hybridized onto an Affymetrix mus 430 2.0 GeneChip to analyze differences in liver gene expression between KO and WT mice.

We are developing medical countermeasures to reduce the injury caused by SM exposure. Screening in the mouse ear vesicant model has identified three effective compounds: dimercaprol (British anti-lewisite), indomethacin, and octyl homovanillamide (OHV). To identify gene expression changes that correlate with compound efficacy we used oligonucleotide microarrays to compare gene expression profiles in vehicle-exposed skin, SM-exposed skin, and skin pretreated with each compound before SM exposure. Mice were topically exposed on the inner surface of the right ear to SM alone or pretreated for 15 min with one of the compounds and then exposed to SM. Left ears were vehicle-exposed. Ear tissue was harvested 24 hr later for ear weight determination (an endpoint indicating compound efficacy). The exposure groups were: methylene chloride (sulfur mustard vehicle); ethanol (drug vehicle); 0.08 mg sulfur mustard; 6.25 mg dimercaprol 15 min before 0.08 mg sulfur mustard; 1.34 mg indomethacin 15 min before 0.08 mg sulfur mustard; 0.6 mg octylhomovanillamide 15 min before 0.08 mg sulfur mustard; 6.25 mg dimercaprol alone; 1.34 mg indomethacin alone; 0.6 mg octylhomovanillamide alone. RNA was extracted from the tissues and used to generate oligonucleotide microarray probes. Principal component analysis of the gene expression data revealed partitioning of the samples based on drug treatment and SM exposure. Vehicle-exposed mouse ears clustered away from the other treatment groups. SM-exposed mouse ears pretreated with dimercaprol or OHV clustered more closely with vehicle-exposed ears, while SM-exposed mouse ears pretreated with indomethacin clustered more closely with SM-exposed ears. This clustering of the samples is supported by the ear weight data, in which the indomethacin group has ear weights closer to the SM-exposed group, whereas the dimercaprol and OHV groups have ear weights closer to the vehicle-exposed group. Correlation coefficients were calculated for each gene based on the correlation between gene expression level and ear weight. These data provide the basis for understanding what gene expression changes are important in the development of effective SM medical countermeasures. Experiment Overall Design: Exposure of mouse ears to sulfur mustard alone, sulfur mustard preceded by drug treatment, or vehicle compounds. Naive controls were also included.

We performed transcriptional profiling using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays containing approximately 22,000 genes to elucidate potential molecular and pathobiological pathways in MPM using discarded human MPM tumor specimens (n=40), normal lung specimens (n=4), normal pleura specimens (n=5), and MPM and SV40-immortalized mesothelial cell lines (n=5). In global expression analysis using unsupervised clustering techniques, we found two potential subclasses of mesothelioma which correlate loosely with tumor histology. We also identified sets of genes with expression levels that distinguish between multiple tumor subclasses, normal and tumor tissues, and tumors with different morphologies. Microarray gene expression data were confirmed using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and protein analysis for three novel candidate oncogenes (NME2, CRI1, and PDGFC) and one candidate tumor suppressor (GSN). Finally, we used bioinformatics tools (i.e. software) to create and explore complex physiological pathways that may be relevant in mesothelioma tumorigenesis, pathobiology, or both. Tissues and cell lines profiled using microarrays. Discarded MPM surgical specimens (n=40), normal pleura specimens (n=5), and normal lung specimens (n=4) were freshly collected (and snap frozen) from patients who underwent surgery at Boston s Brigham and Women s Hospital (BWH) between October 1998 and August 2000. All of these patients underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy with heated intra-pleural cisplatin chemotherapy delivered after the specimens were removed. All normal specimens were obtained from patients who were never diagnosed with MPM. Two human MPM cell lines (MS589 and MS428) were kindly provided by Jonathan A.

To identify genomic responses to the presence or absence of CFTR in pulmonary tissues in vivo, microarray analyses of lung mRNAs were performed on whole lung tissue from mice lacking (CFTR(-)) or expressing mouse CFTR (CFTR(+)). Whereas the histology of lungs from CFTR(-) and CFTR(+) mice was indistinguishable, statistically significant increases in the relative abundance of 29 and decreases in 25 RNAs were identified by RNA microarray analysis. Of RNAs whose expression was consistently altered by the absence of CFTR, functional classes of genes influencing gene transcription, inflammation, intracellular trafficking, signal transduction, and ion transport were identified. RNAs encoding the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (CEBP) delta and interleukin (IL) 1beta, both known to regulate CFTR expression, were induced, perhaps indicating adaptation to the lack of CFTR. RNAs mediating lung inflammation including calgranulin-S100 family members, IL-1beta and IL-4, were increased. Likewise, expression of several membrane transport proteins that interact directly with CFTR were increased, suggesting that CFTR-protein complexes initiate genomic responses. Absence of CFTR influenced the expression of genes modulating diverse pulmonary cell functions that may ameliorate or contribute to the pathogenesis of CF. Lungs from sex-matched littermates at 3, 6, and 11 weeks of agewere carefully dissected and the conducting airways and mediastinal structures removed."	"GEO"	"partial"

"To identify distinct transcriptional patterns between the major subcortical dopamine targets commonly studied in addiction we studied differences in gene expression between the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and dorsal striatum (dStr) using microarray analysis. We first tested for differences in expression of genes encoding transcripts for common neurotransmitter systems as well as calcium binding proteins routinely used in neuroanatomical delineation of brain regions. This a priori method revealed differential expression of corticotropin releasing hormone (Crh), the GABA transporter (Slc6a1), and prodynorphin (Pdyn) mRNAs as well as several others between. Using a Gene ontology tool, functional scoring analysis, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we further identified several physiological pathways that were distinct among these brain regions. These two different analysis both identified calcium signaling, G-coupled protein receptor signaling, and adenylate cyclase-related signaling as significantly different among the BNST, NAc, and dStr. The results support other studies suggesting that crucial pathways involved in neurotransmission are distinct among the BNST, NAc, and dStr, and provide insight into the potential use of pharmacological agents that may target region-specific signaling pathways. Further, these studies provide a framework for future mouse-mouse comparisons of transcriptional profiles after behavioral/pharmacological manipulation. Genome-wide microarray was used to detect gene expression. Global functional profile, transcritional networks and canonical pathways were illustrated from the gene expression patterns. Experiment Overall Design: The genome-wide gene expression of mouse brain region bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, nucleus accumbens, and dorsal striatum were analyzed by Affymetrix Mouse430_2 chip.

The current therapeutic approaches for treating muscle injuries are dependent on the clinical severity but not on the type of injury. The aim of this study was to compare the molecular events accompanying the degeneration and repair phases of contraction- and trauma-induced muscle injuries by applying DNA microarray methodology to two well-characterized mouse models of skeletal muscle injury, i.e., eccentric contraction-induced injury (CI) and traumatic injury induced by freezing (FI). Histopathological evaluation and measurements of muscle strength were accompanied by analyses of expression for 12,488 known genes at four time points ranging from 6 hours to 7 days post-injury. Real-time RT-PCR was used to confirm some of the gene expression temporal profiles. While both types of injury cause early induction of transcription, myogenic, and stress-responsive factors, they also induce injury type-specific gene expression profiles. CI only activates a set of genes associated with the protection and repair of protein and structural integrity while FI activates gene sets which result in extensive inflammatory responses, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, and myofibre and extracellular matrix synthesis. This study identified genes that are candidates for therapeutic manipulation following two disparate types of muscle injury. Experiment Overall Design: 2 types of skeletal muscle injury (eccentric contraction- and freeze-induced) x 4 time points after injury (6 hours, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days post-injury). There were 3 samples for each of the 8 cells with the exception of the 'contraction injury, 1 day post-injury' and 'freeze injury, 7 days post-injury' cells; for each of these 2 cells, there were only 2 samples.

A total of 35 muscle samples from nine individuals (four pediatric and five geriatric) were studied. Factors potentially influencing gene expression in the different samples included individuality, age, muscle type, gender, cause of death, postmortem interval, and ethnicity. The first three factors, in decreasing order, were found to have a significant impact on the stratification of muscle specimens. A novel analytic method, using a second round of normalization, was used to elicit differences between muscle types.

"#E-CBIL-28"	"Transcription profiling of skeletal muscle from diabetic or non-diabetic Mexican Americans with or without a family history of diabetes"	"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. In high-risk subjects, the earliest detectable abnormality is insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Impaired insulin-mediated signaling, gene expression, and glycogen synthesis, and accumulation of intramyocellular triglycerides have all been linked with insulin resistance, but no specific defect responsible for insulin resistance and DM has been identified in humans. To identify genes potentially important in the pathogenesis of DM, we analyzed gene expression in skeletal muscle from healthy metabolically characterized nondiabetic (family history negative and positive for DM) and diabetic Mexican-American subjects. We demonstrate that insulin resistance and DM associate with reduced expression of multiple nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1)-dependent genes encoding key enzymes in oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial function. While NRF-1 expression is decreased only in diabetic subjects, expression of both PPARg coactivator 1-alpha and -beta (PGC1-a/PPARGC1, and PGC1-b/PERC), coactivators of NRF-1 and PPARg-dependent transcription, is decreased in both diabetic subjects and family history positive nondiabetic subjects.

In contrast, the transcriptomes of the cerebral cortex, the caudate nucleus, and the cerebellum differ substantially from each other. Between humans and chimpanzees, 10% of genes differ in their expression in at least one region of the brain. The majority of these expression differences are shared among all brain regions. Whereas genes encoding proteins involved in signal transduction and cell differentiation differ significantly between brain regions within individuals, no such pattern is seen between the species. However, a subset of genes that show expression differences between humans and chimpanzees are distributed nonrandomly across the genome.

All subjects underwent a thorough screening process before being admitted into the study. Subjects were first screened by telephone, and were then subject to a medical evaluation. Consent from their family physician was required, and then all potential subjects underwent a resting electrocardiogram, and a sub-maximal graded exercise test on a bicycle ergometer witih a 12-lead ECG. Exclusion criteria included: evidence of coronary hear disease; congestive heart failure; uncontrolled hypertension; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; diabetes mellitus; renal failure; major orthopaedic disability; and smoking. None of the subjects had ever participated in a structured exercise program. After subjects were advised of the benefits and risks of participation, subjects gave their written informed consent. The study was approved by the McMaster University and Hamilton Health Sciences Research Ethics Board and conferred to the principles of the declaration of Helsinki. Exercise Training Resistance training was performed three times weekly on non-consecutive days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for 12 weeks, under strict supervision. Prior to and after each training session subjects were required to perform passive stretching. Resistance exercise for each session consisted of 3 sets of 10 repetitions for each of leg press and leg extension. Training progressed from one set of each exercise at 50% of the initial 1 repetition maximum (1RM) to 3 sets at 80% of 1RM over the training period. Training logs were kept to record the volume and intensity of each session. The 1RM was re-evaluated every 2 weeks, and the training load was adjusted accordingly. All exercises were performed on universal strength training equipment (Universal Gym Equipment, Inc., Cedar Rapids, Iowa). Muscle Biopsy A muscle biopsy was taken from the vastus lateralis muscle of both legs before as well as after the training period, 20 cm proximal to the knee joint using a modified Bergstr m needle (5 mm diameter) with suction modification. The biopsy specimen was dissected of fat and connective tissue and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples were stored at -80 C for subsequent analysis. All subjects were required to abstain from strenuous physical activity for 48 hours prior to the testing session. The non-trained leg performed an acute bout of exercise at the same relative intensity of the training leg to allow for the determination of the effect of training and the effect of acute resistance exercise."" Additional Notes: 1) The samples of 8 out 12 were used in the gene expression study. 2) The 2 factors in this study are: 2.1) Leg - Left or Right 2.2) Training - Baseline: samples taken on each leg before exercise - Resistance Training: one of the legs was subject to resistance training followed by acute exercise - Acute Exercise: the other leg had only the acute exercise 3) The baseline samples will be used for right versus left leg comparison to see variance between legs for human experimentation technical issues. The samples from Resistance or Acute Exercise will be compared to corresponding baseline samples to evaluate the effect of both exercise programs on gene expression."	"ArrayExpress"	"partial"

U95A Affymetrix DNA chips that contain oligonucleotide arrays of approximately 12,000 well-characterized human genes were used in the study. The statistical analysis of the Affymetrix data, based on the ranking of the Student-test statistic, revealed a complex regulation of molecular stress and immune gene responses. The majority of the 266 induced-genes in affected and unaffected psoriatic skin were involved with interferon mediation, immunity, cell-adhesion, cytoskeleton restructuring, protein trafficking and degradation, RNA regulation and degradation, signaling transduction, apoptosis and atypical epidermal cellular proliferation and differentiation. The disturbances in the normal protein degradation equilibrium of skin were reflected by the significant increase in the gene expression of various protease inhibitors and proteinases including the induced components of the ATP/ubiquitin-dependent non-lysosomal proteolytic pathway that is involved with peptide processing and presentation to T-cells. Some of the upregulated genes, such as TGM1, IVL, CSTA, FABP5 and SPRR, are well known psoriatic markers involved in atypical epidermal cellular organization and differentiation. In the comparison between the affected and unaffected psoriatic skin, the transcription factor JUNB was found at the top of the statistical rankings for the 51 significantly upregulated genes in affected skin, suggesting that it has an important but as yet undefined role in psoriasis. Our gene expression data and analysis suggest that psoriasis is a chronic IFN and T-cell-mediated immune disease of the skin where the imbalance in epidermal cellular structure, growth and differentiation arises from the molecular antiviral stress signals initiating inappropriate immune responses.

To date, the vast majority of these experiments have focused on specific biological processes and perturbations. Here, we have generated and analyzed gene expression from a set of samples spanning a broad range of biological conditions. Specifically, we profiled gene expression from 91 human and mouse samples across a diverse array of tissues, organs, and cell lines. Because these samples predominantly come from the normal physiological state in the human and mouse, this dataset represents a preliminary, but substantial, description of the normal mammalian transcriptome. We have used this dataset to illustrate methods of mining these data, and to reveal insights into molecular and physiological gene function, mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, disease etiology, and comparative genomics. Finally, to allow the scientific community to use this resource, we have built a free and publicly accessible website (http://expression.gnf.org) that integrates data visualization and curation of current gene annotations."

"GSE4035"	"Transcription profiling of two mouse lines displaying different phenotypes on fear conditioning to identify identify differences in gene expression in two key brain regions: amygdala and hippocampus"	"Fear conditioning (FC) is a behavioral paradigm that measures an animal s ability to learn fear related information. FC is measured by pairing a mild foot-shock with the surroundings in which the shock was received. Upon being placed back in the context, mice exhibit freezing behavior, which is a species-specific response to fear. We have used selective breeding to produce lines of mice with high or low levels of freezing behavior. We are able to identify alleles that govern the genetic variability for FC by using chromosomal markers in these lines. Using microarrays, we will identify differences in gene expression in two key brain regions: amygdala and hippocampus. Gene expression differences and data regarding chromosomal regions involved in the behavior will be compared to identify particular genes that are both differentially expressed and whose expression is governed by alleles that fall into critical chromosomal regions.,We will compare gene expression in the amygdala and hippocampus (brain regions known to be relevant to fear behavior) from the two lines of mice and use Bayesian statistics in an effort to identify gene expression that affects fear behavior.,We hypothesize that selection has acted in part by changing the frequency of alleles that cause differential expression of key genes in the amygdala and hippocampus of our selected lines. Selective breeding changes the frequency of trait relevant (FC) alleles. A relevant allele is expected to increase in one selected line and decrease in the oppositely selected line. Some trait relevant alleles are expected cause changes in the level of expression at particular genes.,Amygdala and hippocampus will be rapidly dissected out of experimentally na ve mice from each line. Na ve mice will be used for expression studies since the behavior of the mice in the FC test can be reliably anticipated due to their lineage. We have practiced these procedures, and can accurately and reproducibly remove these regions in less than 5 minutes. Different mice will be used to collect each brain region, since the dissection of hippocampus disrupts the removal of amygdala. We will collect enough samples from each region to accommodate a total of 6 microarrays per brain region, per line, thus we will use a total of 24 microarrays. We anticipate that a single brain region will be sufficient to for a microarray. However, we propose to utilize three samples per microarray, because this will reduce variability due to environmental factors and due to slight variability in our dissection procedures. Once this tissue is removed, we will isolate RNA for shipment to the Microarray consortium. We will also collect spleens from each subject as a source of genomic DNA, in order to permit direct comparison of genotype and expression phenotypes. Once we have the results of the microarray analysis, we use WebQTL.org to identify the chromosomal locations of alleles that are know to influence the expression of genes for which we have found differential expression. We will then superimpose this information on trait relevant chromosomal regions identified from our selected lines. This will allow us to rapidly identify genes which may account for genetic variability in FC due to differential expression. Such genes will then be subjected to further study."	"GEO"	"partial"

Here we report on the analysis of microarray expression profiles of sigmoid colon mucosal biopsies from IBS patients and healthy control subjects. Two samples were collected from each individual. From 10 individuals, a third sample was collected 2-3 months after the initial collection. The repeat samples were used to assess the robustness of the expression profiles over different locations within the colon and over time. This analysis revealed a number of differentially expressed genes in IBS patients, which point to functional alterations of specific components of the host defence system and the immune response. This is in support of an important role for peripheral gastrointestinal changes underlying the aetiology of IBS. Two gene probe sets with the most strikingly increased expression in mucosal colon biopsies of IBS patients represent a gene that is, as yet, uncharacterised (DKFZP564O0823).

In order to understand the genetic basis of variation in gene expression between normal human individuals, we need to obtain genome-wide expression data from various populations. Studies in monozygotic twins could enable us to estimate the size of the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the natural variation in gene expression. In this work, we report the gene expression analysis of 5 pairs of monozygotic twins and 3 unrelated individuals; Normal healthy twin pairs were recruited for the study. Three more normal individuals including two females and one male were recruited. First, labeled products were hybridized with the Affymetrix GeneChip Test3 arrays.

We introduce an analytical strategy, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, designed to detect modest but coordinate changes in the expression of groups of functionally related genes. Using this approach, we identify a set of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation whose expression is coordinately decreased in human diabetic muscle. Expression of these genes is high at sites of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, activated by PGC-1a, and correlated with total-body aerobic capacity.

In this study, we used microarray expression profiling to examine the gene expression patterns in superficial transitional cell carcinoma (sTCC) with surrounding CIS (13 patients), without surrounding CIS lesions (15 patients), and in muscle invasive carcinomas (mTCC; 13 patients). Hierarchical cluster analysis separated the sTCC samples according to the presence or absence of CIS in the surrounding urothelium. We identified a few gene clusters that contained genes with similar expression levels in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) with surrounding CIS and invasive TCC. However, no close relationship between TCC with adjacent CIS and invasive TCC was observed using hierarchical cluster analysis. Expression profiling of a series of biopsies from normal urothelium and urothelium with CIS lesions from the same urinary bladder revealed that the gene expression found in sTCC with surrounding CIS is found also in CIS biopsies as well as in histologically normal samples adjacent to the CIS lesions. Furthermore, we also identified similar gene expression changes in mTCC samples. We used a supervised learning approach to build a 16-gene molecular CIS classifier. The classifier was able to classify sTCC samples according to the presence or absence of surrounding CIS with a high accuracy. This study demonstrates that a CIS gene expression signature is present not only in CIS biopsies but also in sTCC, mTCC, and, remarkably, in histologically normal urothelium from bladders with CIS.

Biopsies were obtained from renal cortex and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChips. For control kidneys we identified 1380 genes present on all 6 samples that had a signal intensity greater than 1000. Functional classification of these revealed genes for cellular signaling (201; 15%), regulation of transcription (156; 11%), cellular transport (144; 10%) and cellular metabolism (111; 8%). A class comparison between the controls and LDN kidneys yielded 865 differentially expressed genes.

METHODS: We compared the gene-expression profile of CD44+CD24-/low tumorigenic breast-cancer cells with that of normal breast epithelium. Differentially expressed genes were used to generate a 186-gene invasiveness gene signature (IGS), which was evaluated for its association with overall survival and metastasis-free survival in patients with breast cancer or other types of cancer. RESULTS: There was a significant association between the IGS and both overall and metastasis-free survival (P<0.001, for both) in patients with breast cancer, which was independent of established clinical and pathological variables. When combined with the prognostic criteria of the National Institutes of Health, the IGS was used to stratify patients with high-risk early breast cancer into prognostic categories (good or poor); among patients with a good prognosis, the 10-year rate of metastasis-free survival was 81%, and among those with a poor prognosis, it was 57%. The IGS was also associated with the prognosis in medulloblastoma (P=0.004), lung cancer (P=0.03), and prostate cancer (P=0.01). The prognostic power of the IGS was increased when combined with the wound-response (WR) signature. CONCLUSIONS: The IGS is strongly associated with metastasis-free survival and overall survival for four different types of tumors. This genetic signature of tumorigenic breast-cancer cells was even more strongly associated with clinical outcomes when combined with the WR signature in breast cancer. Expression profling was performed on 6 tumorigenic, 3 non tumorigenic samples of breast tumors and 3 normal breast samples on two different platforms GPL96 and GPL97. A gene signature was derived by comparing the gene expressions of 6 tumorigenic samples with 3 normal breast samples."	"GEO"	"partial"

"GSE7342"	"Transcription profiling of mouse embryonic day 13.5 and 15.5 fetal livers lacking p38alpha, a mitogen-activated kinase that controls inflammatory responses and cell proliferation"	"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38alpha controls inflammatory responses and cell proliferation. Using mice carrying conditional p38alpha alleles, we investigated its function in postnatal development and tumorigenesis. When p38alpha is specifically deleted in the mouse embryo, fetuses develop to term but die shortly after birth, likely due to lung dysfunction. Fetal hematopoietic cells and embryonic fibroblasts deficient in p38alpha display increased proliferation, resulting from sustained activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun pathway. Importantly, in chemical-induced liver cancer development, mice with liver-specific deletion of p38alpha show enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and tumor development that also correlates with JNK/c-Jun upregulation. Furthermore, increased proliferation of p38alpha-deficient hepatocytes and tumor cells is suppressed by inactivation of JNK or c-Jun. These results reveal a novel mechanism whereby p38alpha negatively regulates cell proliferation through antagonizing the JNK/c-Jun pathway in multiple cell types and in liver cancer development. We used microarrays to identifiy differental regulated genes by p38alpha in fetal liver cells Experiment Overall Design: Wild type and p38 deficient fetal liver cell were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays."

"E-AFMX-11"	"Transcription profiling of humans and chimpanzees in brain, heart, liver, kidney, and testis"	"The determination of the chimpanzee genome sequence provides a means to study both structural and functional aspects of the evolution of the human genome. Here we compare humans and chimpanzees with respect to differences in expression levels and protein-coding sequences for genes active in brain, heart, liver, kidney, and testis. We find that the patterns of differences in gene expression and gene sequences are markedly similar. In particular, there is a gradation of selective constraints among the tissues so that the brain shows the least differences between the species whereas liver shows the most. Furthermore, expression levels as well as amino acid sequences of genes active in more tissues have diverged less between the species than have genes active in fewer tissues. In general, these patterns are consistent with a model of neutral evolution with negative selection. However, for X-chromosomal genes expressed in testis, patterns suggestive of positive selection on sequence changes as well as expression changes are seen. Furthermore, although genes expressed in the brain have changed less than have genes expressed in other tissues, in agreement with previous work we find that genes active in brain have accumulated more changes on the human than on the chimpanzee lineage."

"GSE2240"	"Transcription profiling of human atrial and ventricular myocardium from patients atrial tissue of patients with sinus rhythm vs. human left ventricular non-failing myocardium to identify the transcriptional basis for ultrastructural and functional specialization of human atria and ventricles"	"Note this data set has identical data files: Files GSM40994.txt and GSM40995.txt. GSE2240 contains two different experimental subsets:; 1) Comparison of atrial and ventricular gene expression (atrial tissue of patients with sinus rhythm vs. human left ventricular non-failing myocardium); The purpose of our investigation was to identify the transcriptional basis for ultrastructural and functional specialization of human atria and ventricles. Using exploratory microarray analysis (Affymetrix U133A+B), we detected 11,740 transcripts expressed in human heart, representing the most comprehensive report of the human myocardial transcriptome to date. Variation in gene expression between atria and ventricles accounted for the largest differences in this data set, as 3.300 and 2.974 transcripts showed higher expression in atria and ventricles, respectively. Functional classification based on Gene Ontology identified chamber-specific patterns of gene expression and provided molecular insights into the regional specialization of cardiomyocytes, correlating important functional pathways to transcriptional activity: Ventricular myocytes preferentially express genes satisfying contractile and energetic requirements, while atrial myocytes exhibit specific transcriptional activities related to neurohumoral function. In addition, several pro-fibrotic and apoptotic pathways were concentrated in atrial myocardium, substantiating the higher susceptibility of atria to programmed cell death and extracellular matrix remodelling observed in human and experimental animal models of heart failure. Differences in transcriptional profiles of atrial and ventricular myocardium thus provide molecular insights into myocardial cell diversity and distinct region-specific adaptations to physiological and pathophysiological conditions (Barth AS et al., Eur J Physiol, 2005). 2) Comparison of atrial gene expression in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased expression of ventricular myosin isoforms in atrial myocardium, regarded as part of a dedifferentiation process. Whether re-expression of ventricular isoforms in atrial fibrillation is restricted to transcripts encoding for contractile proteins is unknown. Therefore, this study compares atrial mRNA expression in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation to atrial mRNA expression of patients with sinus rhythm as well as to ventricular gene expression using Affymetrix U133 arrays. In atrial myocardium, we identified 1.434 genes deregulated in atrial fibrillation, the majority of which, including key elements of calcium-dependent signaling pathways, displayed down-regulation. Functional classification based on Gene Ontology provided the specific gene sets of the interdependent processes of structural, contractile and electrophysiological remodeling. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time a prominent up-regulation of transcripts involved in metabolic activities, suggesting an adaptive response to an increased metabolic demand in fibrillating atrial myocardium. Ventricular-predominant genes were five times more likely to be up-regulated in atrial fibrillation (174 genes up-regulated, 35 genes down-regulated), while atrial-specific transcripts were predominantly down-regulated (56 genes up-regulated, 564 genes down-regulated). Overall, in atrial myocardium, functional classes of genes characteristic of ventricular myocardium were found to be up-regulated (e.g. metabolic processes) while functional classes predominantly expressed in atrial myocardium were down-regulated in atrial fibrillation (e.g. signal transduction and cell communication). Therefore, dedifferentiation with adoption of a ventricular-like signature is a general feature of the fibrillating atrium, uncovering the transcriptional response pattern in pmAF (Barth AS et al., Circ Res, 2005)."

"GSE8269"	"Transcription profiling of mouse uterus from _gravidl_d18 wild type vs. Cox-1 knockout animal"	"Background: Preterm birth is the leading cause of all infant mortality. In 2004, 12.5% of all births were preterm. In order to understand preterm labor, we must first understand normal labor. Since many of the myometrial changes that occur during pregnancy are similar in mice and humans and mouse gestation is short, we have studied the uterine genes that change in the mouse during pregnancy. Here, we used microarray analysis to identify uterine genes in the gravid mouse that are differentially regulated in the cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mouse model of delayed parturition. Methods: Gestational d18.0 uteri (n=4) were collected from pregnant wild-type and cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mice. Part of the uterus was used for frozen sections and RNA was isolated from the remainder. Microarray analysis was performed at the Indiana University School of Medicine Genomic Core and analyzed using the Microarray Data Portal. Northern analysis was performed to confirm microarray data and the genes localized in the gravid uterus by in situ hybridization. Results: We identified 277 genes that are abnormally expressed in the gravid d18.0 cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mouse. Nine of these genes are also regulated in the normal murine uterus during the last half of gestation. Many of these genes are involved in the immune response, consistent with an important role of the immune system in parturition. Expression of 4 of these genes; arginase I, IgJ, Tnfrsf9 and troponin; was confirmed by Northern analysis to be mis-regulated during pregnancy in the knockout mouse. In situ hybridization of these genes demonstrated a similar location in the gravid wild-type and Cox-1 knockout mouse uteri. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the uterine location of these 4 genes in the mouse during late pregnancy. There are several putative transcription factor binding sites that are shared by many of the 9 genes identified here including; estrogen and progesterone response elements and Ets binding sites. In summary, this work identifies 9 uterine murine genes that may play a role in parturition. The function of these genes is consistent with an important role of the immune system in parturition. Experiment Overall Design: Gestational d18.0 uteri (n=4) were collected from pregnant wild-type and cyclooxygenase-1 knockout mice. Part of the uterus was used for frozen sections and RNA was isolated from the remainder. Microarray analysis (affymetrix 430 2.0) was performed at the Indiana University School of Medicine Genomic Core and analyzed using the Microarray Data Portal. In order to reduce the number of candidate parturition-related genes identified we compared the genes identified as abnormally expressed in the Cox-1 KO uterus to the genes that we had previously identified as changing from gestational d13.5 to d19.0 in the wild-type mouse uterus.

The atrioventricular (AV) valves of the heart develop from undifferentiated mesenchymal endocardial cushions, that later remodel into stratified valves with diversified extracellular matrix (ECM). Because the mature valves express genes associated with osteogenesis and exhibit disease-associated calcification, we hypothesized the existence of shared regulatory pathways active in the remodeling AV valves and in bone progenitor cells. In order to define gene regulatory programs of valvulogenesis relative to osteoblast progenitors, we undertook Affymetrix gene expression profiling analysis of murine embryonic day (E)12.5 AV cushions compared to E17.5 remodeled AV valves (mitral and tri-cuspid) and to pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 (subclone4) cells. Overall MC3T3 cells were significantly more similar to E17.5 valves than to E12.5 cushions, supporting the hypothesis that valve remodeling involves the expression of many genes also expressed in osteoblasts. Several transcription factors characteristic of mesenchymal and osteoblast precursor cells, including Twist1 are predominant in E12.5 cushion. Valve remodeling also includes differential regulation of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors as well as characteristic collagen isoform switching. Among the most highly enriched genes during valvulogenesis were members of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family including Asporin, a known negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. Together, these data support shared gene expression profiles of the remodeling valves and osteoblast bone precursor cells in normal valve development and homeostasis with potential functions in calcific valve disease.

"GSE1835"	"Transcription profiling of mouse retina response to myocilin. Russell-7U24NS043571-02"	"Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease in which vision is lost as a result of the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells. When the trabecular meshwork cells, that regulate aqueous humor outflow, are stressed as they are in some forms of glaucoma, they considerably up-regulated secretion of a protein called myocilin into the aqueous. The function of this protein is unclear; but since some aqueous humor flows to the posterior of the eye, the effects of myocilin will also be felt by the retinal cells. We have a transgenic mouse that secretes large amounts of myocilin into aqueous humor. In these mice, there is a deposition of myocilin on membranes of certain cells suggesting myocilin might have some signaling functions. This signaling function could explain why stresses that increase intraocular pressures can increase the likelihood for glaucoma, cause the myocilin to be secreted at very high levels by the trabecular meshwork. Myocilin may be important in treating glaucoma. This experiment will determine if myocilin is altering gene expression in the retina. The results should show variations in expression levels and will give us some indication of the pathways that are important to preserve retinal ganglion cells after a diagnosis of glaucoma. Our hypothesis is that myocilin is acting like a signaling protein in the eye. It acts not only in the anterior segment but also in retina as a result of the flow of some aqueous to the back of the eye. This signaling function is protective to certain ocular cells. This function of myocilin may influence cells in the retina and may counter the apoptotic signals in the retinal ganglion cells that occur during glaucoma. Retinas from transgenic mice and from mice of the same strain that do not have the transgene will be dissected. The mice will be three weeks of age. Because of the small size of the retina, samples will be pooled to obtain the RNA necessary to run the microarray. Three control and three transgenic samples will be run and compared with each other. We have data indicating that myocilin is at high levels in the aqueous humor of the transgenic animals."	"GEO"	"partial"		
"GSE11201"	"Transcription profiling of mouse developing liver compared both to normal adult liver and non-hepatic embryonic tissues"	"Understanding congenital liver disease requires elucidation of the signaling pathways and transcriptional events in the developing liver. Comprehensive assessment of gene expression between 10.5 and 16.5 dpc in the developing mouse liver and comparison with adult liver and non-hepatic embryonic tissue was validated with real-time PCR and in situ hybridization. The broad nature of the analysis provides insights into patterns of genetic control of hepatogenesis. Pathways implicated in human disease are highly regulated at the transcriptional level. Rather than activating or inhibiting a pathway or biological process by altering the expression of a single signaling molecule, transcriptional changes in large numbers of genes in a pathway or process are regulated in a coordinated manner. For example, both TGF-beta and Notch signaling is inhibited during hepatogenesis not just by decreasing transcription of multiple pathway members, but also with a complementary increase in the transcription of a pathway inhibitor. Similarly, genes related to specific biological processes exhibit strong temporal synchronization in which multiple members of the pathway have similar transcriptional regulation over time. Global coordination of signaling or functional families at the transcriptional level may be a mechanism to produce robustness of the desired outcomes. In addition, this comprehensive analysis provides a database for the further study of transcriptional events during liver development by identifying liver-specific, highly regulated genes.

Although much is already known about the function of PPAR in hepatic lipid metabolism, many PPAR -dependent pathways and genes have yet to be discovered. In order to obtain an overview of PPAR -regulated genes relevant to lipid metabolism, and to probe for novel candidate PPAR target genes, livers from several animal studies in which PPAR was activated and/or disabled were analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChips. Numerous novel PPAR -regulated genes relevant to lipid metabolism were identified. Out of this set of genes, eight genes were singled out for study of PPAR -dependent regulation in mouse liver and in mouse, rat, and human primary hepatocytes, including thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip), electron-transferring-flavoprotein polypeptide (Etfb), electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase (Etfdh), phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (Pctp), endothelial lipase (EL, Lipg), adipose triglyceride lipase (Pnpla2), hormone-sensitive lipase (Lipe), and monoglyceride lipase (Mgll). Using an in silico screening approach, one or more PPAR response elements (PPREs) were identified in each of these genes. Since Pnpla2, Lipe, and Mgll contribute to hepatic triglyceride hydrolysis, gene regulation was studied under conditions of elevated hepatic lipids. In wild-type mice fed a high fat diet, the decrease in hepatic lipids following treatment with the PPAR agonist Wy14643 was paralleled by significant up-regulation of Pnpla2, Lipe, and Mgll, suggesting that induction of triglyceride hydrolysis may contribute to the anti-steatotic role of PPAR .

This stage of development is referred to as the pseudoglandular phase, histologically characterized by loose mesenchyme surrounding undifferentiated epithelial tubes. We have undertaken a comprehensive gene expression profiling of the entire process of murine lung development using oligonucleotide-based microarrays. Our data reveals the expression pattern of ~ 11,000 genes throughout the morphologic stages of lung development.

"GSE9743"	"Transcription profiling of mouse mutant Dstcorn1 cornea vs. wild type"	"Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton through actin dynamics (assembly and disassembly of filamentous actin) is known to be essential for numerous basic biological processes. In addition, recent in vitro studies provided evidence that actin dynamics participate in the control of gene expression. A spontaneous mouse mutant, corneal disease 1 (corn1), is deficient for a regulator of actin dynamics, destrin (DSTN; also known as actin depolymerizing factor or ADF), and develops epithelial hyperproliferation and neovascularization in the cornea. Dstncorn1 mice exhibit the actin dynamics defect in the corneal epithelial cells as evidenced by increased filamentous actin, offering an in vivo model to investigate the physiological significance of the transcriptional regulation by actin dynamics. To examine the effect of the Dstncorn1 mutation on gene expression, we performed a microarray analysis using the cornea from Dstncorn1 and wild-type control mice. A dramatic alteration of gene expression was observed in the Dstncorn1 cornea, with 1,226 annotated genes differentially expressed. Functional annotation of these genes revealed that most significantly enriched functional categories are associated with actin and/or cytoskeleton. Among genes that belong to these categories, a considerable number of serum response factor (SRF) target genes were found, indicating the existence of the actin-SRF pathway of transcriptional regulation in vivo. A comparative study using an allelic mutant strain, Dstncorn1-2J, with milder corneal phenotypes also suggested that the severity of the actin dynamics defect correlates with the level of gene expression changes. Our study provides evidence that actin dynamics have a strong impact on gene expression in vivo. Experiment Overall Design: Microarray analysis was performed in triplicate with RNA from each genotype, A. BY H2bc H2-T18f/SnJ (A. BY wild-type), A.

Comparison between the transcriptomes of macrodissected and microdissected samples showed that the LCM samples allowed detection of significantly higher numbers of differentially expressed genes, with higher statistical rates of significance. These results validate LCM as a reliable technique for in vivo genomic studies in the brain hippocampus, where contamination by surrounding areas (not expressing Ras-GRF1) increases background noise and impairs identification of differentially expressed genes. Comparison between wild type and knockout LCM hippocampus samples revealed that Ras-GRF1 elimination caused significant gene expression changes, mostly affecting signal transduction and related neural processes. The list of 36 most differentially expressed genes included loci concerned mainly with Ras/G protein signaling and cytoskeletal organization (i.e. 14-3-3 / , Kcnj6, Clasp2) or related, cross-talking pathways (i.e. jag2, decorin, strap). Consistent with the phenotypes shown by Ras-GRF1 knockout mice, many of these differentially expressed genes play functional roles in processes such as sensory development and function (i.e. Sptlc1, antiquitin, jag2) and/or neurological development/neurodegeneration processes affecting memory and learning. Indeed, potential links to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD) or Creutzfeldt-Jacobs disease (CJD), have been reported for a number of differentially expressed genes identified in this study (Ptma, Aebp2,Clasp2, Hebp1, 14-3-3 / , Csnk1 , etc.). These data, together with the previously described role of IRS and insulin (known Ras-GRF1 activators) in AD, warrant further investigation of a potential functional link of Ras-GRF1 to neurodegenerative processes.

"GSE3915"	"Transcription profiling of mouse PKCa -/- mutant vs. wild type small intestine"	"Members of the PKC family of serine / threonine kinases play key regulatory roles in numerous cellular processes including differentiation and proliferation. Of the eleven mammalian PKC isoforms known several have been implicated in tumor development and progression. However, in most cases isotype specificity is poorly defined and even contrary functions for a single PKC have been reported, mostly because appropriate molecular and genetic tools were missing to specifically assess the contribution of single PKC isoforms in vivo. In this report we therefore used PKC genetic targeting to study the role of PKCa and PKCz in colorectal cancer. Both isoforms were found to be strongly down-regulated in intestinal tumors of ApcMin/+ mice. A deletion of PKCz did not affect tumorigenesis in this animal model. In contrast, PKCa deficient ApcMin/+ mice developed more aggressive tumors and died significantly earlier than their PKCa proficient littermates. Even without an additional Apc mutation PKCa knock out mice showed an elevated tendency to develop spontaneous intestinal tumors. Transcriptional profiling revealed a role for this kinase in regulating EGFR signaling and proposed a synergistic mechanism for EGFR / AP-1 and WNT / APC pathways in mediating intestinal tumor development. Experiment Overall Design: Adult male animals (PKCa -/- and congenic wt controls; 50-60 days old) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Small intestines were dissected and total RNA (~5 g per sample) was extracted using the QIAGEN RNeasy kit.

"GSE13033"	"Transcription profiling of mouse brain tissue from HtrA2 knockouts"	"Cellular stress responses can be activated following functional defects in organelles such as mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by loss of the serine protease HtrA2 leads to a progressive movement disorder in mice and has been linked to parkinsonian neurodegeneration in humans. Here we demonstrate that loss of HtrA2 results in transcriptional up-regulation of nuclear genes characteristic of the integrated stress response, including the transcription factor CHOP, selectively in the brain. We also show that loss of HtrA2 results in the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the mitochondria, defective mitochondrial respiration and enhanced production of reactive oxygen species that contribute to the induction of CHOP expression and to neuronal cell death. CHOP expression is also significantly increased in Parkinson s disease patients brain tissue. We therefore propose that this brain-specific transcriptional response to stress may be important in the advance of neurodegenerative diseases. Experiment Overall Design: This experiment was set out to identify genes that are differentially expressed in brain tissue from the cortex of HtrA2 knockout (KO) mice compared to wild type (WT) littermates. We chose a cortical region since there is no evidence of neuronal loss in this region enabling us to compare mRNA transcripts in identical cellular populations.

"GSE12209"	"Transcription profiling of mouse 3 wild-type and 3 Crtc1 knockouts reveals the Creb1 coactivator Crtc1 is required for energy balance and fertility"	"The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin maintains energy balance by acting on hypothalamic leptin receptors (Leprs) that trigger the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). Although disruption of Lepr-Stat3 signaling promotes obesity in mice, other features of Lepr function, such as fertility, seem normal, pointing to the involvement of additional regulators. Here we show that the cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein-1 (Creb1)-regulated transcription coactivator-1 (Crtc1) is required for energy balance and reproduction Crtc1-/- mice are hyperphagic, obese and infertile. Hypothalamic Crtc1 was phosphorylated and inactive in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice; leptin administration increased amounts of dephosphorylated nuclear Crtc1. Dephosphorylated Crtc1 stimulated expression of the Cartpt and Kiss1 genes, which encode hypothalamic neuropeptides that mediate leptin s effects on satiety and fertility. Crtc1 overexpression in hypothalamic cells increased Cartpt and Kiss1 gene expression, whereas Crtc1 depletion decreased it. Indeed, leptin enhanced Crtc1 activity over the Cartpt and Kiss1 promoters in cells overexpressing Lepr and these effects were disrupted by expression of a dominant-negative Creb1 polypeptide. As leptin administration increased recruitment of hypothalamic Crtc1 to Cartpt and Kiss1 promoters, our results indicate that the Creb1-Crtc1 pathway mediates the central effects of hormones and nutrients on energy balance and fertility. Experiment Overall Design: Mice were fasted overnight for 18h and refed for 6h. Hypothalami were obtained from 3 wild-type and 3 Crtc1 knockout mice.

"GSE8555"	"Transcription profiling of murine embryonic head Phgdh knock outs"	"D-3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh; EC 1.1.1.95) is a necessary enzyme for de novo L-serine biosynthesis via the phosphorylated pathway. We demonstrated previously that Phgdh is expressed exclusively by neuroepithelium and radial glia in developing mouse brain and later mainly by astrocytes. Mutations in the human PHGDH gene cause serine deficiency disorders (SDD) associated with severe neurological symptoms such as congenital microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, and intractable seizures. We recently demonstrated that genetically engineered mice, in which the gene for Phgdh has been disrupted, have significantly decreased levels of serine and glycine, and exhibit malformation of brain such as microcephaly. The Phgdh null (KO) embryos exhibit lethal phenotype after gestational day 14, indicating that the phosphorylated pathway is essential for embryogenesis, especially for brain development. It is worth noting that the Phgdh knockout (KO) embryos primarily displayed microcephaly, which is the most conspicuous phenotype of patients with SDD. Thus, Phgdh KO mice are a useful animal model for studying the effect of diminished L-serine levels on development of the central nervous system and other organs. To better understand the mechanism underlying the molecular pathogenesis of SDD, we sought to examine whether gene expression is altered in the Phgdh KO mouse model. We identify genes that have altered expression in the head of the Phgdh KO embryos using the GeneChip array. Some of the genes identified by this method belong in functional categories that are relevant to the biochemical and morphological aberrations of the Phgdh deletion.

"GSE2873"	"Transcription profiling of mouse skeletal muscle to detect genes that regulate motor axon growth and differentiation"	"These experiments are designed to discover genes that are expressed selectively by synaptic nuclei in skeletal muscle with the particular goal of identifying genes that regulate motor axon growth and differentiation. We plan to isolate RNA from the dissected synaptic region of skeletal muscle and from the non-synaptic region of skeletal muscle and to identify the genes that are expressed at higher levels in the synaptic than non-synaptic region. Previously, we showed that motor axons fail to stop and differentiate in mice lacking MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by motor neuron-derived Agrin. We hypothesize that MuSK activation normally leads to the production of a retrograde stop/differentiation signal that is encoded by a gene that is expressed preferentially in synaptic nuclei. In the absence of MuSK signaling, the retrograde signaling is not produced by synaptic nuclei, and consequently motor axons wander aimlessly over the muscle. We obtain 6 to 8 micrograms of total RNA from the dissected synaptic or non-synaptic region from a single P21 mouse diaphragm muscle. This is a standard procedure in the lab, and we have used these methods to analzye gene expression and to generate high-quality cDNA libraries. Because the synaptic zone is narrower in the left hemi-diaphragm, we will isolate RNA from this half of the diaphragm. In order to isolate sufficient RNA (5 micrograms from each sample), we will pool the synaptic and non-synaptic regions from two hemi-diaphragms. In order to reduce experimental variability, we wish to analzye expression in six samples: three samples of synaptic RNA and three samples of non-synaptic RNA. We will ship the isolated RNA samples to the Consortium in order to generate labeled cDNA, to screen Affymetrix mouse oligo arrays and to assist in the analysis. Several genes, including the subunits of the acetylcholine receptor, MuSK, acetylcholinesterase, and utrophin are known to be expressed preferentially in synaptic nuclei; thus, these genes serve as internal controls for the reliability and effectiveness of the screen. Most other genes, several of which we have analyzed in previous studies, including actin, GAPDH, runx1, nogoC, creatine kinase, etc. are expressed uniformly in skeletal muscle; thus, expression of these genes should be equally represented in synaptic and non-synaptic regions.

In order to specifically analyze mRNA transcription, a technique has been developed that can be applied in-vivo in intact cells and animals. The technique is referred with the acronym NIAC-NTR (Non Invasive Application and Capture of Newly Transcribed RNA). This method makes use of the cellular pyrimidine salvage pathway and is based on affinity-chromatographic isolation of thiolated mRNA. When combined with data on mRNA steady-state levels, this method is able to assess the relative contributions of mRNA synthesis and degradation/stabilization. It overcomes limitations associated with currently available methods such as mechanistic intervention that disrupts cellular physiology, or the inability to apply the techniques in-vivo. The method was applied to study renal ischemia reperfusion injury, demonstrating its applicability for whole organs in-vivo. Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays were used to detail regulatory mechanisms of mRNA expression and the relative contributions of RNA synthesis and turnover within distinct pathways, and identification of genes expressed at low abundance at the transcriptional level.

Using microarray technology, the present study demonstrates that the effects of noise overexposure on the expression of molecules likely to be important to the development of NIHL differ among inbred mice that have distinctive susceptibilities to NIHL including B6.CAST, 129X1/SvJ, and 129S1/SvImJ. The noise-exposure protocol produced, on average, a permanent loss of about 40 dB in sensitivity for auditory brainstem responses in susceptible B6.CAST mice, but no threshold elevations for the two resistant 129S1/SvImJ and 129X1/SvJ substrains. Measurements of noise-induced gene expression changes 6 h after the noise exposure revealed significant alterations in the expression levels of 48 genes in the resistant mice, while by these same criteria, there were seven differentially expressed genes in the susceptible B6.CAST mice. Differentially expressed genes in both groups of mice included subsets of transcription factors. However, only in the resistant mice was there a significant induction of proteins involved in cell-survival pathways such as HSP70, HSP40, p21, GADD45 , Ier3, and Nf i . Moreover, increased expression of three of these factors after noise was confirmed at the protein level. Drastically enhanced HSP70, GADD45 , and p21 immunostaining were detected 6 h after the noise exposure in subsets of cells of the lateral wall, spiral limbus, and organ of Corti as well as in cochlear nerve fibers. Upregulation of these proteins after noise exposure likely contributes to the prevalence of survival cellular pathways and thus to the resistance to NIHL that is characteristic of the 129X1/SvJ mice. Experiment Overall Design: Female 10-wk-old mice of the B6.CAST and 129X1/SvJ strains were divided randomly into non-noise control and noise-exposure groups. The non-noise mice served as controls in the gene-profiling experiments to control for the stress induced by experimenter handling and/or confinement of the mice in the noise-exposure chamber that was not directly related to the noise. This mice were in the noise chamber for a sham exposure. In contrast, the noise groups were exposed to a 105-dB SPL, 10-kHz octave band of noise for 1 h and sacrificed 6 h after the exposure. Of each of these major groups, eight mice were used for each of three 129X1/SvJ control and three noise-exposed 129X1/SvJ arrays and two B6.CAST control and two noise-exposed B6.CAST arrays.

"GSE11667"	"Transcription profiling of mouse oocytes to investigate age-associated increase in aneuploidy and changes in gene expression."	"An increase in the incidence of aneuploidy is well documented with increasing maternal age, in particular in human females. Remarkably, little is known regarding the underlying molecular basis for the age-associated increase in aneuploidy, which is a major source of decreased fertility in humans. Using mouse as a model system we find that eggs obtained from old mice (60-70 weeks of age) display a 6-fold increase in the incidence of hyperploidy as assessed by chromosome spreads. Expression profiling of transcripts in oocytes and eggs obtained from young and old mice reveals that approximately 5% of the transcripts are differentially expressed in oocytes obtained from old females when compared to oocytes obtained from young females (6-12 weeks of age) and that this fraction increases to approximately 33% in eggs. The latter finding indicates that the normal pattern of degradation of maternal mRNAs that occurs during oocyte maturation is dramatically altered in eggs obtained from old mice and could therefore be a contributing source to the decline in fertility. Analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts also indicated that the strength of the spindle assembly checkpoint is weakened and that higher errors of microtubule-kinetochore interactions constitute part of molecular basis for the age-associated increase in aneuploidy in females. Last, BRCA1 expression is reduced in oocytes obtained from old females and RNAi-mediated reduction of BRCA1 in oocytes obtained from young females results in perturbing spindle formation and chromosome congression following maturation Experiment Overall Design: We profiled the global gene expression in GV & MII oocyte by maternal aging, and identified the genes differentially expressed."

Numerous studies have revealed the significance of cytokines TNF and IL-1 in the onset and progression of RA. Due to the complexity of interactions among different cytokines and immune cells, little is known about the precise molecular mechanisms underlying RA. In this study, oligonucleotide microarray analysis and a mouse model of RA, IL-1 receptor antagonist deficient mice were used to address this issue. Two hundred and ninety transcripts were found to be dysregulated greater than or equal to 2-fold in the diseased mice. Phase-specific gene expression changes were identified, including early increase and late decrease of heat shock protein coding genes and Cyr61. Moreover, common gene expression changes were also observed, especially the upregulation of paired-Ig-like receptor A (Pira) in both early and late phases of arthritis. We conclude that common and distinct gene expression change patterns that were identified globally may represent novel opportunities for better control of RA through early diagnosis and development of alternative therapeutic strategies.

Differentiation begins with the initiation of stratification, a process tightly controlled through proper gene expression. AP-2 is expressed in skin and previous research suggested a pathway where p63 gene induction results in increased expression of AP-2 which in turn is responsible for induction of K14. This study uses a conditional gene ablation model to further explore the role of AP-2 in skin development. Mice deficient for AP-2 exhibited delayed expression of p63, K14, and K1, key genes required for development and differentiation of the epidermis. In addition, microarray analysis of E16.5 skin revealed delayed expression of additional late epidermal differentiation genes: filaggrin, repetin and secreted Ly6/Plaur domain containing 1, in mutant mice. The genetic delay in skin development was further confirmed by a functional delay in the formation of an epidermal barrier. These results document an important role for AP-2 in skin development, and reveal the existence of regulatory factors that can compensate for AP-2 in its absence.

"GSE11899"	"Transcription profiling of mouse Dicer-deficient liver"	"Background & Aims: MiRNAs are small (~22 nucleotide), non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression through imperfect complementarity with target messenger RNAs. The function of miRNA in mammalian organogenesis is largely unknown. Conditional loss-of-function of Dicer, the enzyme that processes precursor miRNA transcripts into their mature, active form, has been shown to cause severe defects in a number of organ systems. Here we address the role of Dicer in liver development and function. Methods: Mice lacking Dicer function in hepatocytes were generated using an Afp-Cre strain to drive deletion of a floxed Dicer allele. Deletion of the flox-dicer allele was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Decreased miRNA levels detected by quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization confirmed loss of Dicer function. Gene expression microarray analysis was performed on liver RNA from P28 mutant and control mice. Liver sections from mutant and control mice ranging from embryonic stages through 3-4 months of age were examined and liver function tests were performed on adult mice. Results: Mice lacking hepatocyte Dicer function were born alive at the expected frequency, and had grossly normal appearance and behavior. Despite the loss of mature miRNA, hepatic function was normal, as reflected by normal blood gludose, albumin, cholesterol, and bilirubin. However, mutant mice between 2-4 months of age exhibit progressive hepatocyte damage, elevated ALT/AST, with evidence of balanced proliferation and apoptosis in the lobule. Microarray analysis indicates large-scale changes in gene expression, with increased expression of many miRNA targets, as well as imprinted genes. Conclusions: Loss of miRNA processing in the liver at late gestation has a remarkably mild phenotype, suggesting that miRNAs do not play an essential role in hepatic physiology. However, miRNA deficiency results in hepatocyte apoptosis and balanced hepatocyte regeneration. Finally, microarray analysis of gene expression in mutant liver suggests a previously unrecognized role for Dicer in the repression of imprinted genes. Experiment Overall Design: Hepatic RNA was isolated from 5 control and 5 DicerloxP/loxP;Afp-Cre+ mice at P28."	"GEO"	"partial"

"GSE6614"	"Transcription profiling of mouse brains following nicotine-induced seizures"	"Nicotine, acting through the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), can induce seizures in mice. We aimed to study brain transcriptional response to seizure and to identify genes whose expression is altered after nicotine-induced seizures. Whole brains of untreated mice were compared to brains one hour after seizure activity, using Affymetrix U74Av2 microaarays. Experimental groups included wild-type mice and both nicotine-induced seizures sensitive and resistant nAChR mutant mice. Each genotype group received different nicotine doses to generate seizures. This approach allowed the identification of significantly changed genes whose expression was dependent on seizure activity, nicotine administration or both, but not on the type of nAChR subunit mutation or the amount of nicotine injected. Significant expression changes were detected in 62 genes (p < 0.05, FDR correction). Among them, GO functional annotation analysis determined that the most significantly over-represented categories were of genes encoding MAP kinase phosphatases, regulators of transcription and nucleosome assembly proteins. In-silico bioinformatic analysis of the promoter regions of the 62 changed genes detected the significant enrichments of 16 transcription regulatory elements (TREs), creating a network of transcriptional regulatory responses to seizures. The TREs for ATF and SRF were most significantly enriched, supporting their association with seizure activity. Our data suggest that nicotine-induced seizure in mice is a useful model to study seizure activity and its global brain transcriptional response. The differentially expressed genes detected here can help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying seizures in animal models, and may also serve as candidate genes to study epilepsy in humans. Experiment Overall Design: Whole brain expression profiles were determined in two experimental groups of mice, sixteen mice that were not treated with nicotine and twelve mice one hour after experiencing nicotine-induced seizure. The untreated group included six wild-type mice, five alpha7+/T and five beta4-/- mice. The group of mice that underwent nicotine-induced seizures included three wild-types, five alpha7+/T and four beta4-/- mice. Different doses of nicotine were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) to each genotype group of mice in order to achieve a similar seizure score in all three genotypes."	"GEO"	"partial"

Although much is already known about the function of PPAR in hepatic lipid metabolism, many PPAR -dependent pathways and genes have yet to be discovered. In order to obtain an overview of PPAR -regulated genes relevant to lipid metabolism, and to probe for novel candidate PPAR target genes, livers from several animal studies in which PPAR was activated and/or disabled were analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChips. Numerous novel PPAR -regulated genes relevant to lipid metabolism were identified. Out of this set of genes, eight genes were singled out for study of PPAR -dependent regulation in mouse liver and in mouse, rat, and human primary hepatocytes, including thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip), electron-transferring-flavoprotein polypeptide (Etfb), electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase (Etfdh), phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (Pctp), endothelial lipase (EL, Lipg), adipose triglyceride lipase (Pnpla2), hormone-sensitive lipase (Lipe), and monoglyceride lipase (Mgll). Using an in silico screening approach, one or more PPAR response elements (PPREs) were identified in each of these genes. Since Pnpla2, Lipe, and Mgll contribute to hepatic triglyceride hydrolysis, gene regulation was studied under conditions of elevated hepatic lipids. In wild-type mice fed a high fat diet, the decrease in hepatic lipids following treatment with the PPAR agonist Wy14643 was paralleled by significant up-regulation of Pnpla2, Lipe, and Mgll, suggesting that induction of triglyceride hydrolysis may contribute to the anti-steatotic role of PPAR .

The DBA/2J (DBA) mice have been used as a model of AHL and undergoes progressive, age-related hearing loss by 12 weeks of age. Here we analyzed cochlear gene expression of 7-week-old and 36-week-old DBA mice using microarrays. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) analysis confrimed that severe age-related hearing loss occured in 36-week-old mice, whereas moderate hearing loss occured in 7-week-old mice. Comprehensive gene expression analysis identified genes correlated with AHL and revealeed that 15 mitochondrial process categories, including mitochondrial electron transport chain , oxidative phosphorylation , respiratory chain complex I , respiratory chain complex IV , and respiratory chain complex V , were statistically associated with AHL-correlated genes in the cochlea of 36-week-old DBA mice, and that 25 genes encoding components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (respiratory chain complex I, IV, and V) were significantly down-regulated in the cochlea. These observations provide evidence that AHL is associated with down-regulation of genes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain in the cochlea of DBA mice, and suggest that mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction may be a key feature of AHL in mammalian cochlea. Experiment Overall Design: To determine the effects of age-related hearing loss, each 7-week-old sample (n = 3) was compared to each 36-week-old sample (n = 3), generating a total of nine pairwise comparisons.

The corneal epithelium is one of the most densely innervated tissues of the body. The characteristics of the cornea are established during fetal development, and are lost in adult life when the cornea regenerates after injury. The common reaction of the cornea to injury is the formation of opaque scars, the ingrowth of blood vessels, and distinct changes in the innervation pattern. Scar formation of the cornea is critically modulated by the expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). To identify genes that are important for corneal transparency, dense innervation and absence of blood vessels by comparing corneas from wildtype mice with those that are under the influence of high doses of TGF-beta. Transparency, dense innervation, and absence of blood vessels in the cornea all depend on the expression of a critical set of genes that are not expressed when TGF-beta is present. Mice were generated that overexpress TGF-beta under control of a strong lens-specific promoter. These mice developed opaque corneas that are vascularized and lack sensory nerves. In addition, these corneas were densely populated with cells expressing neural cell adhesion protein.

For this purpose, we developped a large-scale gene expression approach on heart and skeletal tissues from Lmna H222P heterozygous Knock-In mouse model. Experiment Overall Design: In the project presented here we performed differential expression in heart from a mouse model of EDMD: a LmnaH222P knock-in mouse created via homologous recombination by Gisele Bonne in Paris, France (Arimura et al., 2005). The mutant male LmnaH222P knock-in homozygous mice display reduced locomotion activity with abnormal stiff walking posture and all of them die by 9 months of age. As for cardiac phenotype, they develop chamber dilation and hypokinesia with conduction defects. These results demonstrate that LmnaH222P knock-in homozygous mice represents a good model for studying laminopathies affecting striated muscles as they develop a dystrophic condition of both skeletal and cardiac muscles reminiscent of the human diseases.

"GSE6065"	"Transcription profiling of mouse virulence models to investigate urine host cell response to Aeromonas infection"	"Aims: To assess the virulence of multiple Aeromonas spp. using two models, a neonatal mouse assay and a mouse intestinal cell culture. Methods and Results: Transcriptional responses to both infection models were evaluated using microarrays. After artificial infection with a variety of Aeromonas spp., mRNA extracts from the two models were processed and hydridized to murine microarrays to determine host gene response. Definition of virulence was determined based on host mRNA production in murine neonatal intestinal tissue and mortality of infected animals. Infections of mouse intestinal cell cultures were then performed to determine whether this simpler model system's mRNA responses correlated to neonatal results and therefore be predictive of virulence of Aeromonas spp. Virulent aeromonads up-regulated transcripts in both models including multiple host defense gene products (chemokines, regulation of transcription and apoptosis, cell signaling). Avirulent species exhibited little or no host response in neonates. Mortality results correlated well with both bacterial dose and average fold change of up-regulated transcripts in the neonatal mice. Conclusions: Cell culture results were less discriminating but showed promise as potentially being able to be predictive of virulence. Jun oncogene up-regulation in murine cell culture is potentially predictive of Aeromonas virulence. Significance and Impact of the Study: Having the ability to determine virulence of waterborne pathogens quickly would potentially assist public health officials to rapidly assess exposure risks. Experiment Overall Design: Two infection models were assessed, live, whole animals (neonatal Swiss Webster mice) and a murine small intestinal cell culture. Biological replicates (n=5) were infected with different Aeromonas species/strains and compared to uninfected controls."	"GEO"	"partial"

Our goal is to generate a detailed spatial map of the cellular expression of selected regulatory genes during mammalian kidney development. The goal of this study is to identify a population of genes that are enriched in the renal vesicle (RV) and its derivatives using Wnt4 mutants. Experiment Overall Design: Wnt4 is required for renal vesicle (RV) induction. Therefore, RV and the derivatives (s-shaped body and eventually the mature nephron) are missing in Wnt4 mutants. At E14.5, these structures are present in wildtype kidneys. Transcriptional profile comparison between E14.5 wildtype and Wnt4 mutants therefore identify genes expressed in the RV and derivatives.

"GSE11900"	"Transcription profiling of mouse developing and adult cornea compared to the lens and tendon"	"The cornea continues to mature after birth to develop a fully functional, refractive and protective barrier tissue. Here we investigated the complex biological events underlying this process by profiling global genome-wide gene expression patterns of the immature postnatal day 10 and seven week-old adult mouse cornea. The lens and tendon were included in the study to increase the specificity of genes identified as up regulated in the corneal samples. Notable similarities in gene expression between the cornea and the tendon were in the mesenchymal extracellular matrix collagen (types I, III, V, VI) and proteoglycan (lumican, decorin and biglycan) genes. Expression similarities in the cornea and lens were limited to certain epithelial genes and the crystallins. Approximately 76 genes were over expressed in the cornea samples that showed basal expression levels in the lens and tendon. Thirty-two of these were novel with no known functions in the cornea. These include genes with a potential role in protection against oxidative stress (Dhcr24, Cdo1, Akr1b7, Prdx6), inflammation (Ltb4dh, Wdr1), ion-transport (Pdzk1ip1, Slc12a2, Slc25a17) and transcription (Zfp36l3, Pdzk1ip1). Direct comparison of the cornea of two ages showed selective up regulation of 50 and 12 genes in the P10 and adult cornea, respectively. Of the up regulated P10 genes several encode extracellular matrix collagens and proteoglycans that are stable components of the adult cornea and their high transcriptional activity at P10 indicate a period of active corneal growth and matrix deposition in the young cornea. Much less is known about the genes selectively over expressed in the adult cornea; some relate to immune response and innervations (Npy), and possibly to electron transport (Cyp24a1, Cyp2f2) and others of yet unknown functions in the cornea (Rgs10, Psmb8, Xlr4)). This study detected expression of genes with known functions in the cornea, providing additional validation of the microarray experiments. Importantly, it identified several novel genes whose functions have not been investigated in the cornea. Experiment Overall Design: Briefly, the corneas were dissected free of the limbus from postnatal day 10 (P10) and seven-week old (adult) mice. To enrich for stromal contribution, the epithelium was scraped off and the cornea placed in TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The scraping off of the epithelium reduced, but did not abrogate epithelial contribution, as judged by the expression of known epithelial markers. The lens and the flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendon were removed from seven-week old adult mice for isolation of total RNA. For the adult cornea three independent preparations of total RNA was generated. For all the other tissues two independent preparations of total RNA were used. The adult and the P10 microarrays were used as baselines in our previous study of corneal cells in culture to identify genes differentially expressed by cultured cells of the stroma (Chakravarti et al. 2004). Experiment Overall Design: The output fluorescence of the scanned images was analyzed first using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software to compute absolute expression, background calculation and detection call (present, absent or marginal). Background signal was between 42 to 55 arbitrary units, while the noise to signal ratio was between 1.42 to 1.78 arbitrary units. The expression data from all nine arrays were further analyzed as follows. The model-based DNA-Chip Analyzer (dChip) software (http://www.dchip.org/) was used to normalize the data from the image files for array-to-array comparison (Li and Wong 2001). This software uses an invariant-set algorithm as a basis for normalization and a model-based expression index to calculate the expression value for each transcript. To identify gene expression patterns that were statistically significantly different between any two given tissue types, we used the following criteria: (1) fold change 2; (2) difference of mean expression index 100 arbitrary units; (3) t-statistic, p < 0.05."

Overall 720 genes are expressed differentially in the proximal tubules of the Dent Clcn5 knockout mouse model compared to those of control wild type mice. The fingerprint of these gene changes may help us to understand the phenotype of Dent disease. Experiment Overall Design: Renal proximal tubules were dissected from wild type and Clcn5 knockout mice. Mice were anesthetized with halothane, the abdominal aorta of each animal was accessed and the left kidney was perfused with an ice-cold salt. Proximal tubule dissection was performed in an ice-cold salt solution.

The strain has an average litter size of more than 13 pups, and females commonly nurse up to 18 pups with greater than 90% survival to weaning. Along with an increased body weight (BW), these traits are clearly indicative of enhanced lactation performance (Knight et al., 1986). Indeed lactation performance, assessed by a weigh-suckle-weigh method, was 3-fold greater in QSi5 mice than the CBA strain (Riley et al., 2006). In this study, we utilize the divergent phenotypes of QSi5 and CBA/CaH mice to identify genes associated with enhanced mammary gland capacity.

It is widely regarded as a mechanobullous disease, resulting from a weakened cytoskeleton, causing extensive cytolysis. It was postulated by others that certain K14 mutations induce TNF-alfa and increase apoptosis. Here, we report that in K5-/- mice , the mRNA and protein levels of TNF-alfa remain unaltered. Transcriptome analysis of K5-/- mice revealed however, that the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-1beta were significantly upregulated at the mRNA level in K5-/- mouse skin. These results were confirmed by TaqMan real-time PCR and ELISA assays. We hypothesize that keratin mutations contribute to EBS in a mouse model by inducing local inflammation that mediates a stress response. Experiment Overall Design: Two groups were K5-/- skin and wildtype . Six animals were included in each group. All the total RNA samples were isolated from tissues taken immediately after birth, and were pooled for later microarray experiments.

"GSE8249"	"Transcription profiling of mouse Foxo3 mutant ovaries vs. wild types to discover and classify ovarian fertility factors."	"Female infertility syndromes are among the most prevalent chronic health disorders in women, but their molecular basis remains unknown because of the complexity of oogenesis and uncertainty regarding the number and identity of ovarian factors controlling the assembly, preservation, and maturation of ovarian follicles. To systematically discover such ovarian fertility factors en masse, we employed a mouse model (Foxo3), where follicles are assembled normally but are then synchronously activated. Gene expression profiling of mutant and normal ovaries led to the identification a surprisingly large set of ovarian factors. The set included the vast majority of known ovarian factors, many of which when mutated produce female sterility phenotypes, but most were novel. Subsequent analyses revealed novel classes of ovarian factors and significant overrpresentation on the X chromosome, among other insights into the general properties of oogenesis genes and their patterns of expression. Experiment Overall Design: Total ovarian RNA from +/+ and -/- ovaries at PND1, 3, 7, and 14 (n=3 replicates per timepoint and genotype, a total of 24 microarrays) was subjected to linear RNA amplification and hybridized to Affymetrix 430 2.0 mouse whole-genome microarrays, which interrogate >39K transcripts including the vast majority of protein-coding genes.

"GSE6979"	"Transcription profiling of mouse kidney from FGF23, TG and WT mice"	"Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), a circulating protein produced in bone, causes renal inorganic phosphate (Pi) wasting by down-regulation of sodium phosphate co-transporter 2a (Npt2a). The mechanism behind this action is unknown. We have previously generated transgenic mice (TG) expressing human wild-type FGF23 under the control of the 1 (I) collagen promoter. In this study we performed a large scale gene expression study of kidneys from TG mice and wild-type littermates. Several genes that play a role in Pi regulation had decreased expression levels, such as Npt2a, but also Pdzk1 which is a scaffolding protein known to interact with NPT2a. Importantly, the Klotho gene, a suggested crucial co-factor for FGF23 receptor binding and activation, was the most affected decreased gene. However, other genes proposed to regulate Pi levels, such as secreted Frizzled Related Protein 4 (sFRP4), Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) and the FGF-receptors 1-4, revealed no changes. Interestingly, expression levels of inflammatory response genes were increased and histological analysis revealed tubular nephropathy in the TG mice kidneys. In conclusion, FGF23 TG mice have altered kidney gene expression levels of several genes thought to be part of Pi homeostasis and an increase in inflammatory response genes, data supported by histological analysis. These findings may lead to further understanding of how FGF23 mediates its actions on renal Pi regulation.

To better understand the immune mechanisms contributing to clearance of infection, microarray methods were used to examine differential gene expression in the lungs of C57BL/6 and CD40 ligand knock-out (CD40L-KO) mice over time following exposure to Pneumocystis. Immuncompetent C57BL/6 mice, which control and clear infection efficiently, showed a robust response to infection characterized by the upregulation of 349 primarily immune-response associated genes. Temporal changes in the expression of these genes suggested that there was an early (week 2) primarily innate response, that waned without controlling infection; this were followed by primarily adaptive immune responses that peaked at week 5 and successfully cleared the infection. In conjunction with the latter, there was an increased expression of B cell associated (immunoglobulin) genes at week 6 that persisted through 11 weeks. In contrast, CD40L-KO mice, which are highly susceptible to developing severe Pneumocystis pneumonia, showed essentially no upregulation of immune-response associated genes at days 35 to 75. Immunohistochemical staining supported these observations by demonstrating an increase in CD4+, CD68+, and CD19+ cells in C57BL/6 but not CD40L-KO mice. Thus, the healthy host demonstrates a robust biphasic response to infection by Pneumocystis; CD40 ligand is an essential upstream regulator of the adaptive immune responses that efficiently control infection and prevent development of progressive pneumonia. Experiment Overall Design: In experiment 1, C57BL/6 and CD40L-KO mice were co-housed in 2 cages; one cage was exposed to a P. murina-infected seeder, while the second was unexposed. Mice (3 per group) were sacrificed at day 32. Because the initial study demonstrated very little change in gene expression in CD40L-KO mice, only C57BL/6 mice were used for experiments 2 and 3. In Experiment 2, three cages (10 animals/cage) were set up: 2 cages were exposed to P. murina, and one was unexposed. Animals (5 per cage) were sacrificed at days 34 and 41. In Experiment 3, which focused on gene expression early after exposure to P. murina, five cages (9-10 animals/cage) were set up, of which 3 were exposed and 2 were unexposed. Animals (1-3 per cage) were sacrificed at days 7, 14 and 21 of exposure.

Here we show that exposure of mice to cold led to conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown-like adipose tissue, accompanying the switch of an active angiogenic phenotype. Gene expression profile analysis showed VEGF was upregulated via most likely hypoxia-independent PGC-1 transcriptional activation. Intriguingly, VEGFR2 blockage abolished the cold-induced angiogenesis, significantly impaired nonshivering thermogenesis capacity, and markedly reduced adipose metabolism. Unexpectedly, VEGFR1 blockage resulted in opposite effects by increasing adipose vascularity and metabolism. These findings demonstrate that VEGFR2 and VEGFR1 mediate polarized activities in modulating adipose angiogenesis and metabolism. Taken together, our findings have conceptual implications in applying angiogenesis modulators for the treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders.

"GSE7958"	"Transcription profiling of mouse striatum from 3- and 18-month-old Q92 vs. control animals"	"Achieving a mechanistic understanding of disease and initiating preclinical therapeutic trials necessitate the study of huntingtin toxicity and its remedy in model systems. To allow the engagement of appropriate experimental paradigms, Huntington s disease (HD) models need to be validated in terms of how they recapitulate a particular aspect of human disease. In order to examine transcriptome-related effects of mutant huntingtin, we compared striatal mRNA profiles from seven genetic mouse models of disease to that of postmortem human HD caudate using microarray analysis. Transgenic models expressing short N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (R6/1 and R6/2 mice) exhibited the most rapid effects on gene expression, consistent with previous studies. Although changes in the brains of knock-in models of HD took longer to appear, 15-month and 22-month CHL2Q150/Q150, 18-month HdhQ92/Q92 and 2-year-old YAC128 animals also exhibited significant HD-like mRNA signatures. When the affected genes were compared across models, a robust concordance was observed. Importantly, changes concordant across multiple lines mice were also in excellent agreement with the mRNA changes seen in human HD caudate. Although it was expected that the expression of full-length huntingtin transprotein might result in unique gene expression changes compared to those caused by expression of an N-terminal huntingtin fragment, no discernable differences between full-length and fragment models were detected. There was, however, an overall concordance between transcriptomic signature and disease stage. We thus conclude that the transcriptional changes of HD can be modelled in several available lines of transgenic mice, comprising lines expressing both N-terminal and full-length mutant huntingtin proteins. The combined analysis of mouse and human HD transcriptomes provides an important chronology of mutant huntingtin's gene expression effects.

"GSE9330"	"Transcription profiling of mouse wild type and Ctip2-/- (Bcl11b) mutant striatum at P0"	"Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) are critically involved in motor control, and their degeneration is a principal component of Huntington s disease. We find that the transcription factor Ctip2 (also known as Bcl11b) is central to MSN differentiation and striatal development. Within the striatum, it is expressed by all MSN, while it is excluded from essentially all striatal interneurons. In the absence of Ctip2, MSN do not fully differentiate, as demonstrated by dramatically reduced expression of a large number of MSN markers, including DARPP-32, FOXP1, Chrm4, Reelin, MOR1, GluR1, and Plexin-D1. Furthermore, MSN fail to aggregate into patches, resulting in severely disrupted patch-matrix organization within the striatum. Finally, heterotopic cellular aggregates invade the Ctip2-/- striatum suggesting a failure by MSN to repel these cells in the absence of Ctip2. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms that underlie Ctip2-dependent differentiation of MSN and that underlie the patch-matrix disorganization in the mutant striatum, we directly compared gene expression between wild type and mutant striatum at P0. Because CTIP2-expressing MSN constitute 90-95% of the neurons within the striatum, we reasoned that we should be able to detect changes in medium spiny neuron gene expression in Ctip2 null mutants. We microdissected out small regions of striatum at matched locations in wild type and Ctip2-/- mutant littermates at P0 and investigated gene expression with Affymetrix microarrays. We selected the 153 most significant genes and further analyzed them to identify a smaller set of genes of potentially high biological relevance. In order to verify the microarray data and define the distribution of the identified genes in the striatum, we performed in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry for 12 selected genes: Plexin-D1, Ngef, Nectin-3, Kcnip2, Pcp4L1, Neto1, Basonuclin 2, Fidgetin, Semaphorin 3e, Secretagogin, Unc5d, and Neurotensin. We find that all these genes are either specifically downregulated (Plexin-D1, Ngef, Nectin-3 Kcnip2, Pcp4L1, Neto1), or upregulated (Basonuclin 2, Fidgetin, Semaphorin 3e, Secretagogin, Unc5d, Neurotensin), in the Ctip2-/- striatum, confirming and extending the microarray results. Together, these data indicate that Ctip2 is a critical regulator of MSN differentiation, striatal patch development, and the establishment of the cellular architecture of the striatum. Experiment Overall Design: Matched regions of striatum from wild type and Ctip2-/- mice were obtained via 500 m diameter punch biopsies performed in the center of the developing striatum in acutely sectioned 300 m coronal slices of the brain at postnatal day 0 (P0). Sections were matched rostro-caudally between wild type and null mutant tissue, and fiduciary landmarks were used to assure reproducible microdissection of comparable regions. RNA was extracted using the StrataPrep Total RNA Mini Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and RNA quality was assayed using a bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Paola Alto, CA). To ensure reproducibility and biological significance, microarrays were performed with RNA samples from three independent wild type, one heterozygote, and four Ctip2-/- mice (biological replicates). Microarray data were normalized using the RMA function within Bioconductor (Irizarry et al., 2003). Statistical significance of gene expression differences between wild type and knockout was determined using Statistical Analysis of Micrarrays (SAM) (Tusher et al., 2001).

"GSE4752"	"Transcription profiling of mouse cerebral cortext from Egr1/3 double knockout vs. wild type"	"The early growth response (Egr) family of transcriptional regulators consists of four closely related molecules (Egr1-4) that regulate target genes involved in cellular growth and differentiation. In the brain, Egr transcription factors have a critical role in learning and memory processing, presumably by regulating effector target genes that alter synaptic efficacy or mediate structural changes in neurons. Previous work suggests that Egr1 and Egr3 are the most important synaptic activity induced Egr molecules in the brain and they appear to have redundant regulatory function. How Egr transcriptional regulators influence learning and memory processing in the brain is unknown because target genes regulated by them have not been identified. Using Affymetrix microarray analysis and Egr loss-of-function mice, we will begin to characterize the gene regulatory networks modulated by Egr transcription factors in the brain. We anticipate that basic mechanisms related to transcriptional control of learning and memory related plasticity and the identification of plasticity effector molecules that may be involved in synaptic dysfunction associated with degenerative diseases or brain injury will result from these studies. To identify Egr transcription factor target gene regulation in brain: Target genes regulated by Egr transcription factors have not been identified in the brain, yet the transcription factors are essential for normal learning and memory processes. Using Egr1/3 double knockout and wild type littermate mice, we will compare gene expression profiles from somatosensory cortex to identify genes that are deregulated in Egr1/3 dKO brains. Egr1 and Egr3 gene expression is coupled to synaptic N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling engaged by NMDA receptor activation and long term synaptic potentiation (LTP). Previous studies have demonstrated defects in late phase LTP, long-term memory in hippocampal dependent tasks and reconsolidation of memories in Egr1-deficient mice, but the target effector molecules regulated by Egr transcription factors are not known. We hypothesize that it will be possible to identify Egr dependent target genes by using Affymetrix microarray analysis to compare gene expression from wild type cerebral cortex that has high levels of Egr protein expression with gene expression in cortex from Egr1/3 double knockout mice. Egr1 and Egr3 are highly expressed in mouse cortex and hippocampus twenty one days after birth because of the large amount of maternal stimulation they receive prior to weaning. We will compare the gene expression profile in somatosensory cortex from P21 wild type mice to that of P21 Egr1/3 dKO mice. We will perform microarray analysis using the Mouse 430 2.0 gene array with RNA samples from 3 wild type and 3 1/3 dKO brains (6 arrays total). Differentially regulated genes (up-regulated and down-regulated) will be identified from the list of genes with significantly altered expression greater than or equal to 2-fold by paired T test. Interesting genes will be validated by real-time PCR in wild type and 1/3 dKO brains. Our main goal is to identify genes that are directly regulated by Egr3. Recognizing that both direct and indirect target genes may be identified in the list of differentially expressed genes, real-time PCR validated target genes will be further screened using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with PCR (ChIP-PCR) to determine whether Egr1 and/or Egr3 are bound to potential regulatory regions of the putative target genes."

Aqp11 / mice neonatally suffer from polycystic kidneys derived from the proximal tubule. Its onset is proceeded by the vacuolization of ER. However, the mechanism for the formation of vacuoles and the development of cysts remain to be clarified. Here, we show that Aqp11 / mice and polycystic kidney disease animals share a common pathogenic mechanism of cyst formation. Experiment Overall Design: Aqp11+/ mice, originally generated in a 129/SvEvBrd background (4), were back-crossed 10 11 times to a C57/BL6 background. Heterozygous mice were interbred to obtain knockout (Aqp11 / ) and wild-type littermates (Aqp11+/+). The genotypes of offsprings were analyzed by PCR using tail DNA as a template. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Tokyo. One-week-old mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Kidneys were rapidly excised on ice, washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, immersed in RNAlater (Ambion) and stored at 20 C. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and cleaned up using an RNeasy minikit with DNase treatment (Qiagen).

A distinct phase of pancreas development, known as the secondary transition, is initiated at day 13 of development and one of the key features of this transition is a massive increase in the number of mature endocrine cells. To study gene expression in pancreas during the secondary transition we performed high-density oligonucleotide microarray experiments on dorsal pancreas tissue isolated from NMRI embryos on consecutive days from e12.5 to e16.5. Experiment Overall Design: Dorsal pancreata were isolated from embryos at embryonic day 12.5, 13.5, 14.5, 15.5, and 16.5 and pooled litter-wise prior to total RNA extraction.

"GSE8311"	"Transcription profiling of mouse GE+/ and MGE-/-, and 2) primary cells+/ and primary cells-/-"	"The Dlx homeodomain transcription factors are implicated in regulating the function of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons; therefore understanding their functions will provide insights into disorders such as epilepsy, mental retardation and autism. Identifying genes that are downstream of Dlx1/2 function and are relevant for the differentiation and survival of GABAergic interneurons. During embryonic development, cortical GABAergic interneurons are generated in the proliferative zone of the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), from where they migrate to reach their final positions in the cortex. The differentiation of these interneuron precursors is dependent on Dlx genes, as shown by Dlx1/Dlx2 double mutants, which have a block in GABAergic cell differentiation and in cell migration. When interneuron progenitors are isolated from the mutant MGE and growth in culture, they are able to proceed along their differentiation program. However, mutant cells growth in vitro show defects in cell morphogenesis and increased cell apoptosis. We hypothesize that Dlx transcription factors regulate important aspects of GABAergic neuron differentiation such as the formation and growth of axon and dendrites, and the formation of inhibitory synapses. We generated E15.5 mouse embryos that are Dlx1/2 -/- or Dlx1/2 +/?. Genotype was confirmed by PCR. A total of 8 litters were used. For each experiment, we pooled tissue from at least 6 different embryos of the same genotype. We dissected the ventricular and subventricular zones of the MGE (rostral part).

"GSE5243"	"Transcription profiling of mouse kidney - effect of Hyp, low phosphate diet and sex"	"The renal adaptation to changing dietary phosphate levels is not well understood. The dominant Hyp mutation of the Phex gene in mice causes X-linked hypophosphatemia with low renal retention of phosphate and blocks physiologic adaptation to low phosphate diets. At P < 0.01, there were 1,711 transcripts significantly affected by genotype, 1,428 by diet and 5,601 by sex. Many renal transporters other than phosphate, as well as many novel transcripts of unknown function, were affected by the Hyp mutation. Some genes for fat metabolism and inflammation were up-regulated in Hyp kidneys. Of the genes affected by genotype and diet, only 378 were affected by both. In summary, the Hyp mutation induced changes in mRNA levels for numerous transcripts exceeding that required to alter phosphate retention. The data suggest broader physiological roles for the Phex gene unrelated to phosphate conservation. Keyword = Phex; Keyword = Hyp; Keyword = mouse; Keyword = kidney; Keyword = sex; Keyword = mRNA; Keyword = microarray; Keyword = low phosphorus diet Experiment Overall Design: A 2x2x2 factorial design, balanced for genotype (normal vs. Hyp), diet (control vs. low phosphate), and sex (male vs. female) was employed.

Previous studies in mice with targeted deletions in the three alpha2-adrenoceptor genes have indicated that these receptors are essential for embryonic development. In the present study, we searched for the alpha2-adrenoceptor subtype(s) involved in placental development and its molecular mechanism using mice carrying targeted deletions in alpha2-adrenoceptor genes. Congenic alpha2B-adrenoceptor-deficient mice (Adra2b-/-) developed a defect in fetal and maternal vessel formation in the placenta labyrinth at embryonic day E10.5. This defect was accompanied by reduced endothelial cell proliferation and decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels in Adra2b-/- as compared with Adra2b+/+ placenta. Microarray analysis of wild-type and mutant placentae (maternal genotype Adra2b+/-) revealed 179 genes which were significantly up- or downregulated >1.5-fold in alpha2B-deficient placenta. The type 1 receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (Flt1), which is coexpressed with alpha2B-adrenoceptors in spongiotrophoblast and giant cells of the placenta, was found to be 2.3-fold upregulated in alpha2B-deficient placenta. Neutralization of Flt1 and its soluble splice variant sFlt1 by a specific antibody in vivo prevented the vascular defect in alpha2B-deficient placenta at E10.5. Thus, alpha2B-adrenoceptors are essential to suppress antiangiogenic (s)Flt1 in spongiotrophoblasts to control the coordinated formation of a vascular labyrinth of fetal and maternal blood vessels in the murine placenta during development. Experiment Overall Design: Comparative transcriptome analysis was determined using the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

Although much is already known about the function of PPAR in hepatic lipid metabolism, many PPAR -dependent pathways and genes have yet to be discovered. In order to obtain an overview of PPAR -regulated genes relevant to lipid metabolism, and to probe for novel candidate PPAR target genes, livers from several animal studies in which PPAR was activated and/or disabled were analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChips. Numerous novel PPAR -regulated genes relevant to lipid metabolism were identified. Out of this set of genes, eight genes were singled out for study of PPAR -dependent regulation in mouse liver and in mouse, rat, and human primary hepatocytes, including thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip), electron-transferring-flavoprotein polypeptide (Etfb), electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase (Etfdh), phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (Pctp), endothelial lipase (EL, Lipg), adipose triglyceride lipase (Pnpla2), hormone-sensitive lipase (Lipe), and monoglyceride lipase (Mgll). Using an in silico screening approach, one or more PPAR response elements (PPREs) were identified in each of these genes. Since Pnpla2, Lipe, and Mgll contribute to hepatic triglyceride hydrolysis, gene regulation was studied under conditions of elevated hepatic lipids. In wild-type mice fed a high fat diet, the decrease in hepatic lipids following treatment with the PPAR agonist Wy14643 was paralleled by significant up-regulation of Pnpla2, Lipe, and Mgll, suggesting that induction of triglyceride hydrolysis may contribute to the anti-steatotic role of PPAR . Our study illustrates the power of transcriptional profiling to uncover novel PPAR -regulated genes and pathways in liver. Experiment Overall Design: 3-5 months old male pure bred wild-type (129S1/SvImJ) and PPAR -null (129S4/SvJae) mice were used.

"GSE7309"	"Transcription profiling of mouse preimplantation development"	"Preimplantation development is a crucial step for successful implantation and pregnancy. Although both compaction and blastocyst formation have been extensively studied, mechanisms regulating early cell division stages before compaction have remained unclear. Here, we show that ERK MAP kinase function is required for early embryonic cell division and normal cell-cell adhesion before compaction. Our analysis demonstrates that inhibition of ERK activation in the late 2-cell stage embryos leads to a reversible arrest in G2 phase in the 4-cell stage. The G2 arrested, 4-cell stage embryos show weakened cell-cell adhesion as compared to control embryos. Remarkably, microarray analyses show that most of the programmed changes of upregulated and downregulated gene expression during the 4- to 8-cell stages normally proceed in the 4-cell stage-arrested embryos, except for a portion of the genes whose expression profiles closely parallel the stages of embryonic development when arrested in G2 and released to resume development. These parallel genes include the genes encoding intercellular adhesion molecules, whose expression is found to be positively regulated by the ERK pathway. We also show that while ERK inactivation in the 8-cell stage embryos does not lead to cell division arrest, it does cause cell division arrest when cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion is disrupted. These results demonstrate an essential role of ERK function in the G2/M transition and the expression of adhesion molecules during the 2-cell to 8-cell stage embryos, and suggest a loose parallelism between the gene expression programs and the developmental stages before compaction. Experiment Overall Design: We examined expression profiles of genes during early cell division stages in mouse preimplantation development. We performed the genome-wide analysis by using Affymetrix GeneChip oligonucleotide microarrays, and examined the effect of the ERK pathway inhibitor U0126 on the expression profiles. Two independent experiments were carried out. We collected embryos at six points as follows; control embryos at day 1.5 (cont. 1.5, 2-cell stage), day 2.5 (cont. 2.5, 4- to 8-cell), and day 3.5 (cont. 3.5, morula to blastocyst), and the U0126-treated embryos at day 2.5 (U2.5, 4-cell arrested), embryos released from the U0126-induced arrest at day 3.5 (U3.5, 8-cell) and at day 4.5 (U4.5, morula to blastocyst).

"GSE8191"	"Transcription profiling of mouse mammary gland at key stages in development"	"The transition from pregnancy to lactation is a critical event in the survival of the newborn since all the nutrient requirements of the infant are provided by milk. While milk contains numerous components, including proteins, that aid in maintaining the health of the infant, lactose and milk fat represent the critical energy providing elements of milk. Much of the research to date on mammary epithelial differentiation has focused upon expression of milk protein genes, providing a somewhat distorted view of alveolar differentiation and secretory activation. While expression of milk protein genes increases during pregnancy and at secretory activation, the genes whose expression is more tightly regulated at this transition are those that regulate lipid biosynthesis. The sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) family of transcription factors is recognized as regulating fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. We propose that SREBP1 is a critical regulator of secretory activation with regard to lipid biosynthesis, in a manner that responds to diet, and that the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt influences this process, resulting in a highly efficient lipid synthetic organ that is able to support the nutritional needs of the newborn. Experiment Overall Design: Key points are examined in a time series of FVB mouse mammary gland development, secretory activation, lactation and involution. Quadruplicate mice (four biological replicates) at each time point were used for statistical power totalling 40 individual arrays in this study. Mice were as staged pregnant day 1 the day that post coital plug was observed, and similarly, lactation day 1 was the first day after birth.

Here, we have generated mice lacking exons 3 to 4 of the Pgc1beta gene (PGC1beta E3,4-/E3,4- mice). These mice express a mutant protein that has reduced coactivation activity on a subset of transcription factors, including ERRalpha, a major target of PGC1beta in the induction of mitochondrial gene expression. The mutant mice have reduced expression of OXPHOS genes and mitochondrial dysfunction in liver and skeletal muscle as well as elevated liver triglycerides. Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and insulin signaling studies show that PGC1beta mutant mice have normal skeletal muscle response to insulin, but have hepatic insulin resistance. These results demonstrate that PGC1beta is required for normal expression of OXPHOS genes and mitochondrial function in liver and skeletal muscle. Importantly, these abnormalities do not cause insulin resistance in skeletal muscle but cause substantially reduced insulin action in the liver. Experiment Overall Design: Gene expression levels in liver tissue and quadriceps muscle were compared between WT/Control and PGC1beta mutant tissue. Total RNA was extracted from liver and skeletal muscle using RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer s instructions.

The majority of deregulated genes are cell-proliferation specific and Rb-E2F dependent, causing ME-cell proliferation and gland hyperplasia but not breast cancer formation. In the breast tumor cells, a further 207 genes are differentially expressed, most of them belonging to the cell communication category.

The profile of retransformants shows that only 38 deregulated genes appear to be tumor-relevant and that none of them is considered to be a typical breast cancer gene.

"GSE9738"	"Transcription profiling of mouse neurite outgrowth and regeneration"	"We have undertaken a genome-wide study of transcriptional activity in embryonic superior cervical ganglia (SCG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) during a time course of neurite outgrowth in vitro. Gene expression observed in these models likely includes both developmental gene expression patterns and regenerative responses to axotomy, which occurs as the result of tissue dissection. Comparison across both models revealed many genes with similar gene expression patterns during neurite outgrowth. These patterns were minimally affected by exposure to the potent inhibitory cue Semaphorin3A, indicating that this extrinsic cue does not exert major effects at the level of nuclear transcription. We also compared our data to several published studies of DRG and SCG gene expression in animal models of regeneration, and found the expression of a large number of genes in common between neurite outgrowth in vitro and regeneration in vivo. Experiment Overall Design: We wished to determine the transcriptional profiles of neurons undergoing neurite outgrowth in vitro. We were particularly interested in finding genes whose expression is generally associated with the process of neurite outgrowth, rather than with cell type-specific effects. Thus, in order to avoid focusing on transcripts unique to one tissue type versus another, we used a comparative strategy to look for effects that were common to two tissue types and therefore more likely to be involved in the general process of neurite outgrowth. While these explants contain multiple cell types, we felt this was preferable to the more disruptive conditions required to dissociate neurons or obtain a pure neuron population. To this end, we monitored gene expression in cultured explants from SCG and DRG using DNA microarrays. We initiated our studies by culturing embryonic day 13 (E13) mouse SCG in vitro and harvesting tissue for RNA isolation at time points from 2 to 65 hours. Time points were selected to detect both fast, short-term responses (2, 5 and 12 hours), as well as sustained, long-term changes (24, 40, and 65 hours). Samples were hybridized to Affymetrix MG-U74v2 A and B microarrays, with RNA from acutely dissected explants serving as a baseline reference. We followed these experiments with a parallel analysis of a more heterogeneous tissue type, the DRG, which is more frequently used than SCG for in vivo studies of neurite regeneration.

Objectives: We investigated whether genetically engineered mice with GADD45a deletion were more susceptible to ventilator- or endotoxin (LPS)-induced lung injury. We employed genomic strategies to explore the mechanistic involvement of GADD45a in inflammatory lung injury. Methods: Wild-type C57Bl/6 and GADD45a-/- mice were phenotyped for lung injury following exposure to high tidal volume ventilation (VILI) or intratracheal LPS. Whole lung homogenates were utilized for gene expression studies of ventilated animals and spontaneously breathing controls. To explore the consequences of GADD45a depletion on lung vascular permeability, electrical resistance was measured using human endothelial cells (EC) transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for GADD45a or control sequence, or with active Akt1/PKB cDNA. Results: Mice harboring deletion of GADD45a were modestly susceptible to LPS-induced injury and profoundly susceptible to VILI, demonstrating increased inflammation and increased microvascular permeability. VILI-exposed GADD45a-/- mice manifested striking neutrophilic alveolitis and increased levels of BAL protein, IgG, and inflammatory cytokines. Expression profiling revealed strong dysregulation in the B cell receptor signaling pathway in GADD45a-/- mice, with involvement of several PI3K/Akt signaling components. Akt protein and phospho-Akt were reduced in GADD45a-/- lungs. Further, human EC with reduced GADD45a (siRNA) exhibited potentiated LPS-induced barrier dysfunction, which was attenuated by overexpressing active Akt1. Conclusions: GADD45a, which modulates Akt availability, is a significant participant in modulating vascular permeability and susceptibility to VILI.

In skeletal muscle, laminin a2 chain binds at least two receptor complexes; the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and integrin a7b1. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this disorder, we performed gene expression profiling of laminin a2 chain deficient mouse limb muscle. One of the down-regulated genes encodes a protein called calcium and integrin binding protein 2 (Cib2) whose expression and function is unknown. However, the closely related Cib1 has been reported to bind integrin aIIb and may be involved in outside-in-signaling in platelets. Since Cib2 might be a novel integrin a7b1 binding protein in muscle, we have studied Cib2 expression in the developing and adult mouse. Cib2 mRNA is mainly expressed in the developing central nervous system and in developing and adult skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle Cib2 colocalizes with integrin a7B subunit at the sarcolemma and at the neuromuscular- and myotendinous junctions. Finally, we demonstrate that Cib2 is a calcium binding protein that interacts with integrin a7Bb1D. Thus, our data suggest a role for Cib2 as a cytoplasmic effector of integrin a7Bb1D signaling in skeletal muscle Experiment Overall Design: Skeletal muscle (all hind limb skeletal muscle) from 4-weeks old laminin alpha 2 chain deficient mice and 4-weeks old wild type mice were isolated individually and RNA were extracted and hybridized on Affiymetrix microarrys.

Several pre-clinical models carrying germline mutations in the endogenous mouse Apc tumor supressor gene have been generated and their phenotype characterized. The predisposition of these mouse models to multiple intestinal adenomas closely resembles the FAP phenotype at the molecular, cellular and phenotypic level and may prove valuable to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying colorectal tumorigenesis. The goal of this study is to establish an expression signature characteristic of intestinal tumors characterized by the inactivation of Apc. Experiment Overall Design: We have compared 3 intestinal tumor samples collected from the mouse model Apc1638N against 2 normal intestinal samples collected from wild type C57Bl6/J animals. In both cases only epithelial cells were used for the signature since we have collected our samples were laser capture microdissected."	"GEO"	"partial"

"GSE3965"	"Transcription profiling of mouse VP16-CREB transgenics"	"Expression of VP16-CREB, a constitutively active form of CREB, in hippocampal neurons of the CA1 region lowers the threshold for eliciting the late, persistent phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway. This VP16-CREB-mediated L-LTP differs from the conventional late phase of LTP in not being dependent on new transcription. This finding suggests that in the transgenic mice the mRNA transcript(s) encoding the protein(s) necessary for this form of L-LTP might already be present in CA1 neurons in the basal condition. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to identify the mRNAs differentially expressed in the hippocampus of transgenic and wild-type mice. Experiment Overall Design: To identify the specific gene whose induction in hippocampal neurons correlated with the facilitated L-LTP phenotype, we harvested hippocampal mRNA at time points assessed in our physiological study and carried out a gene expression analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays. To obtain a sufficient quantity of poly(A)-RNA and reduce the effect of the biological variability of the sample, hippocampi from 6 to 10 mice matched for genotype and time of induction were pooled together in each sample. The final data set included genechips for animals on dox (gene Off) and for animals that were one, two, and five weeks after removal of dox (gene On). We also included samples from wild-type mice maintained under identical conditions and from transgenic mice that expressed VP16-CREB for three weeks before turning the transgene off again for two weeks with dox (Rev, gene Off). Since the isolation of mRNA from the whole hippocampus favors genes that are more broadly over-expressed in the hippocampus of transgenic mice and, therefore, may lead to an underestimation of the total complement of genes showing an altered expression in specific hippocampal subregions, we extended our comparison between transgenic and wild-type expression profiles using microdissected CA1 regions. We obtained two samples corresponding to VP16-CREB mice three weeks after induction and one sample corresponding to wild-type mice kept in the same conditions.

"GSE5657"	"Transcription profiling of mouse femur in X-linked hypophosphatemia Hyp mutated animals"	"The pathophysiology of the osteomalacia in X-linked hypophosphatemia is uncertain. In this project, genomic DNA microarrays were used to identify novel genes with abnormal mRNA expression levels in mice with the dominant Hyp mutation of the Phex gene. Femoral shafts from five-week-old C57BL/6J mice, male and female, normal and Hyp (hemizygous male and heterozygous female), were flushed with saline to remove the marrow. RNA was extracted from each bone, pooled between two mice for each array, processed to cRNA, and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 GeneChip microarrays with probe sets for 45,101 genes. Twenty microarrays (40 mice) were done with 5 arrays for each treatment group (normal male, Hyp male, normal female and Hyp female). For each gene, factorial analysis of variance was performed for the main effects of genotype (normal vs. Hyp), sex (male vs. female), and genotype-by-sex interaction. The mRNA levels for 54 % of the genes on each array were scored as present. At P < 0.01, 2,635 genes were significant for genotype, 1,488 for sex, and 509 for genotype-by-sex interaction. There were two probes sets for the Phex gene. Probe 1450445, at the 3 end of the coding sequence, was low in normal samples (246 37 (10), mean SEM (n)) and absent in Hyp samples. Probe 1421979, at the far 3 end of the untranslated region of the cDNA, 3,000 base pairs from the coding sequence, was high in normal mice (3,915 315 (10); 8x brighter than the average gene), undetectable in Hyp males, and 725 93 (5) in Hyp females. Both probe sets were scored as absent in kidney tissue. In Hyp bone, male and female, there was significant down-regulation of markers of osteoblasts and bone matrix synthesis with significant up-regulation of markers of blood vessel formation and cytoskeleton. No prominent skeletal gene was up-regulated in Hyp to attempt to compensate for the low skeletal mineralization. The genes with significant genotype-by-sex interaction did not show a marked fold difference between male and female Hyp mice. In conclusion, male and female Hyp mice showed similar depression of mRNA levels of genes related to bone synthesis in the femoral shaft. There was a high signal level from probes for a sequence in the 3 untranslated region of the Phex gene of normal, but not Hyp, mice, suggesting the need for further study of the molecular organization of this gene. Experiment Overall Design: Equal amounts of RNA from two mice, matched for genotype and sex were pooled to create each sample for microarray analysis. Four treatment groups were done: (1) Normal male mice, (2) Hyp male mice, (3) normal female mice, and (4) Hyp female mice. Five replicates were done with each replicate containing one sample from each of the four treatment groups for a total of 20 independent samples (40 mice total).

The following abstract from the published manuscript describes the major findings of this work. A potential link between muscle peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-alpha signaling and obesity-related diabetes.Finck BN, Bernal-Mizrachi C, Han DH, Coleman T, Sambandam N, LaRiviere LL, Holloszy JO, Semenkovich CF, Kelly DP. The role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) in the development of insulin-resistant diabetes was evaluated using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Transgenic mice overexpressing PPARalpha in muscle (MCK-PPARalpha mice) developed glucose intolerance despite being protected from diet-induced obesity. Conversely, PPARalpha null mice were protected from diet-induced insulin resistance in the context of obesity. In skeletal muscle, MCK-PPARalpha mice exhibited increased fatty acid oxidation rates, diminished AMP-activated protein kinase activity, and reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake without alterations in the phosphorylation status of key insulin-signaling proteins. These effects on muscle glucose uptake involved transcriptional repression of the GLUT4 gene. Pharmacologic inhibition of fatty acid oxidation or mitochondrial respiratory coupling prevented the effects of PPARalpha on GLUT4 expression and glucose homeostasis. These results identify PPARalpha-driven alterations in muscle fatty acid oxidation and energetics as a potential link between obesity and the development of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Experiment Overall Design: RNA from two wild-type (non-transgenic (NTG)) and two PPARalpha overexpressing (MCK-PPARa) mice was analyzed. Two replicates of each are provided."	"GEO"	"partial"		
"GSE8949"	"Transcription profiling of mouse aorta during activation of or interference with PPAR gamma signaling."	"Ligand-mediated activation of the nuclear hormone receptor PPAR gamma lowers blood pressure and improves glucose tolerance in humans. Two naturally occurring mutations (P467L, V290M) in the ligand binding domain of PPAR gamma have been described in humans that lead to severe insulin resistance and hypertension. Experimental evidence suggests that these mutant versions of PPAR gamma act in a dominant negative fashion. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying PPAR gamma action in the vasculature, we determined the gene expression patterns in mouse aorta in response to activation or interference with the PPAR gamma signaling pathway. Experiment Overall Design: To assess the response to PPAR gamma interference, we used adult mice containing a dominant negative form of PPAR gamma. These mice have a targeted P465L mutation, which is equivalent to the P467L mutant, described in human patients. Wild-type littermates were used as the genetic control. The PPAR gamma signaling pathway was activated by administration of rosiglitazone for either 2 or 14 days to adult mice (C57BL/6J strain) at a dose of 3 or 10 mg/kg/day via the food. Control mice were fed standard mouse chow. For the microarray hybridizations, 2-3 biological replicates from each experimental group were used. Biological replicates were RNA pooled from 8 different mouse aortas. All the microarray procedures were conducted at the University of Iowa DNA Core facility using standard Affymetrix protocols.

"GSE1830"	"Transcription profiling of mouse spinal cord (L3-L5) between wild type and Egr3-deficient animals to identify spinal cord fusimotor neuron-specific genes"	"Egr3 is a zinc-finger transcription factor involved in growth and development. Egr3-deficient mice have severe sensory ataxia due to failed development of muscle spindle stretch receptors. Sensory and motor neurons that normally innervate spindles are absent in Egr3-deficient mice, presumably as a secondary consequence to the loss of trophic signals produced by spindles during development that are required for innervation and neuron survival. The molecular mechanisms involving motor neuron fate specification, target derived growth factor dependencies, and specification of target innervation have been difficult to study since select markers for functionally specific motor neurons are very poorly characterized. A more thorough understanding of the molecular mediators of motor neuron biology will be important to evaluate the efficacy of new strategies devised to thwart neuron death that occurs in a variety of human motor neuronopathies and neuropathies. To identify genes specifically expressed by spinal cord fusimotor neurons: Many motor neuron specific genes have been described over the years. However, none have been described that distinguish fusimotor neurons from skeletomotor neurons despite the fact that they have distinct muscle targets (muscle spindle stretch receptors) and comprise 25-30% of the spinal motor neuron populations. Since these motor neurons have remarkably different target innervation and function, we hypothesize that they express genes that establish their specific phenotypes during development. We hypothesize that fusimotor neurons can be distinguished in the spinal cord by characterizing fusimotor neuron specific gene expression. Once fusimotor neuron specific genes are identified, they will be used as markers to identify fusimotor neurons in complex neuroglial cell populations in vivo and in vitro. We hypothesize that by characterizing fusimotor neuron specific genes, unique marker molecules will be identified for in vivo and in vitro study of this functionally distinct and important motor neuron subtype. Moreover, we hypothesize that many of the genes that are specifically expressed by fusimotor neurons will be involved in mechanisms related to their fate specification, target innervation and growth factor dependent biology. We will use the Affymetrix microarray platform to identify genes that are specifically expressed by fusimotor neurons in mouse spinal cord. The differential expression analysis will be performed on microdissected segments of spinal cord (L3-L5) from wild type and Egr3-deficient mice. Postnatal Egr3-deficient mice lack muscle spindles and fusimotor neurons in their spinal cords. By comparing gene expression from microdissected segments of spinal cord (L3-L5) between wild type and Egr3-deficient mice, we hypothesize that fusimotor neuron selective genes can be identified. We will microdissect L3-L5 segments of spinal cord using precise anatomical landmarks to ensure that comparable spinal cord regions are anlayzed from each animal. For each microarray experiment, total RNA will be extracted from L3-L5 cords (approximately 2 mm length of spinal cord). The integrity of each RNA sample will be verified by gel electrophoresis. The intact RNA samples from mice of similar genotype will be pooled from three (3) 27-day old animals. The intact cord dissection is easier in young animals (eg: 27-day old) and the phenotype is known to exist at this developmental stage. The RNA from each animal of a similar genotype will be pooled into a single sample to minimize false positive gene calls that may represent genes related to the specific state of vigilance of a particular animal at the time of sacrifice (eg: activity dependent genes). Thus, each of the two RNA samples to be analyzed for a particular microarray experiment will represent RNA from three (3) spinal cords of each genotype. RNA amplification for probe synthesis should not be necessary since we will provide 7 ug of intact pooled total RNA for each sample. For statistical analysis, the experiment will be performed twice. Since the RNA samples are precious, they will be provided to the Array Consortium in two shipments with each of the experiments performed independently."	"GEO"	"partial"

Forced expression of c-Fos and c-Jun in prostate cancer cells results in increased tumorigenicity, activation of Erk MAP kinase, and enhanced survival in the absence of androgens, which are hallmarks of disease progression. In humans, Jun and Fos proteins are significantly up-regulated during prostate cancer progression and significantly correlated with activation of Erk MAP kinase. Most notably, expression of Jun is associated with disease recurrence independent of other currently used prognostic indicators. These analyses reveal a hitherto unappreciated role for AP-1 transcription factors in prostate cancer progression vis- -vis Erk MAP kinase signaling, as well as the identification of a novel marker of disease recurrence, namely c-Jun. Experiment Overall Design: Mouse prostate was collected from wild-type or the Nkx3.1; Pten compound mutant mice at the age of 8-16 months.

"GSE6116"	"Transcription profiling of rat female mouse lung tumors in rodent cancer bioassays - a 13 chemical training set"	"The primary goal of toxicology and safety testing is to identify agents that have the potential to cause adverse effects in humans. Unfortunately, many of these tests have not changed significantly in the past 30 years and most are inefficient, costly, and rely heavily on the use of animals. The rodent cancer bioassay is one of these safety tests and was originally established as a screen to identify potential carcinogens that would be further analyzed in human epidemiological studies. Today, the rodent cancer bioassay has evolved into the primary means to determine the carcinogenic potential of a chemical and generate quantitative information on dose-response behavior in chemical risk assessments. Due to the resource-intensive nature of these studies, each bioassay costs $2 to $4 million and takes over three years to complete. Over the past 30 years, only 1,468 chemicals have been tested in a rodent cancer bioassay. By comparison, approximately 9,000 chemicals are used by industry in quantities greater than 10,000 lbs and nearly 90,000 chemicals have been inventoried by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as part of the Toxic Substances Control Act.

"To test the hypotheses that mutant huntingtin protein length and wild-type huntingtin dosage have important effects on disease-related transcriptional dysfunction, we compared the changes in mRNA in seven genetic mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) and postmortem human HD caudate. Transgenic models expressing short N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (R6/1 and R6/2 mice) exhibited the most rapid effects on gene expression, consistent with previous studies. Although changes in the brains of knock-in and full-length transgenic models of HD took longer to appear, 15- and 22-month CHL2(Q150/Q150), 18-month Hdh(Q92/Q92) and 2-year-old YAC128 animals also exhibited significant HD-like mRNA signatures. Whereas it was expected that the expression of full-length huntingtin transprotein might result in unique gene expression changes compared with those caused by the expression of an N-terminal huntingtin fragment, no discernable differences between full-length and fragment models were detected. In addition, very high correlations between the signatures of mice expressing normal levels of wild-type huntingtin and mice in which the wild-type protein is absent suggest a limited effect of the wild-type protein to change basal gene expression or to influence the qualitative disease-related effect of mutant huntingtin. The combined analysis of mouse and human HD transcriptomes provides important temporal and mechanistic insights into the process by which mutant huntingtin kills striatal neurons. In addition, the discovery that several available lines of HD mice faithfully recapitulate the gene expression signature of the human disorder provides a novel aspect of validation with respect to their use in preclinical therapeutic trials.

The bioassays involved are expensive and time-consuming, requiring nearly lifetime exposures (two years) in mice and rats and costing $2 to $4 million per chemical. Since there are approximately 80,000 chemicals registered for commercial use in the United States and 2,000 more are added each year, applying animal bioassays to all chemicals of concern is clearly impossible. To efficiently and economically identify carcinogens prior to widespread use and human exposure, alternatives to the two-year rodent bioassay must be developed. In this study, animals were exposed for 13 weeks to two chemicals that were positive for liver tumors in the two-year rodent bioassay, two chemicals that were negative for liver tumors, and two vehicle controls.

We used microarray analysis to study the gene groups coordinately expressed temporally during mouse a liver regeneration. One of the syn-expression groups that showed a sharp rise in gene expression immediately after hepatectomy contains a set pancreatic exocrine genes. The syn-expression profile of pancreatic genes and the pancreatic-specific transcription factors Ptf1a and Ipf1 was confirmed using real-time PCR. Electron microscopic examination showed the presence of morphological features reminiscent of pancreatic acinar cells with the presence of characteristic zymogen granules and ER organization. These results indicate that there is a transient liver-to-pancreas transdifferentiation event at the beginning of liver regeneration. A strong coordinated up-regulation of pancreatic genes was found to accompany the injury response in the pancreas, suggesting a compensatory mechanism for pancreatic functions. There seems to be a relationship between the induction of pancreatic genes and acute phase response at the beginning of liver regeneration. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was extracted from livers of mice recovered at Experiment Overall Design: various hours after partial hepatectomy (PHx 4h, 8h, 12h, 36h, Experiment Overall Design: 48h, 72h).

The immediate application of the newly developed V1V3 method to single cells in this stage of mouse embryos revealed the presence of two populations of cells, one with primitive endoderm expression and the other with pluripotent epiblast-like gene expression. The genes expressed differentially between these two populations were well preserved in morphologically differentiated primitive endoderm and epiblast in the embryos one day later (E4.5), demonstrating that the method successfully detects subtle but essential differences in gene expression at the single-cell level among seemingly homogeneous cell populations. This study provides a strategy to analyze biophysical events in medicine as well as in neural, stem cell, and developmental biology, where small numbers of distinctive or diseased cells play critical roles. Experiment Overall Design: We isolated blastocysts at E3.5 and dissociated the ICM into single cells by trypsin-EDTA treatment.

"GSE11114"	"Transcription profiling of mouse masticatory and limb skeletal muscle"	"Distinctions between craniofacial and axial muscles exist from the onset of development and throughout adulthood. The masticatory muscles are a specialized group of craniofacial muscles that retain embryonic fiber properties throughout adulthood, suggesting that the developmental origin of these muscles may govern a pattern of expression that differs from limb muscles. To determine the extent of these differences, expression profiling of total RNA isolated from the masseter and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of adult female mice was performed, which identified transcriptional changes in unanticipated functional classes of genes in addition to those associated with fiber type. In particular, the masseters displayed a reduction of transcripts associated with load-sensing and anabolic processes, and heightened expression of genes associated with stress. Consistent with these observations were a significantly smaller fiber cross-sectional area in masseters, significantly elevated load-sensing signaling (phosphorylated Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)), and increased apoptotic index in masseters compared to TA muscles. Based on these results, we hypothesize that masticatory muscles may sense and respond to load differently than limb muscles, where the drive for anabolic processes is reduced, and cell stress mediated processes are enhanced. These results establish a novel classification for the masseter muscle in the spectrum of skeletal muscle allotypes, and may provide insight into the molecular basis for specific muscle-related pathologies associated with masticatory muscles. Experiment Overall Design: Tissues were isolated from normal adult female mice (C57Bl/6), age 6 months.

"GSE5424"	"Transcription profiling of mouse Foxa2 mutant embryos"	"Background: The Spemann/Mangold organizer is a transient tissue critical for patterning the gastrula stage vertebrate embryo and formation of the three germ layers. Despite its important role during development, there are still relatively few genes with specific expression in the organizer and its derivatives. Foxa2 is a forkhead transcription factor that is absolutely required for formation of the mammalian equivalent of the organizer, the node, the axial mesoderm and the definitive endoderm (DE). However, the targets of Foxa2 during embryogenesis, and the molecular impact of organizer loss on the gastrula embryo, have not been well defined. Results: To identify genes specific to the Spemann/Mangold organizer, we performed a microarray-based screen that compared wild-type and Foxa2 mutant embryos at late gastrulation stage (E7.5). We could detect genes that were consistently down-regulated in replicate pools of mutant embryos versus wild-type, and these included a number of known node and DE markers. We selected 314 genes without previously published data at E7.5 and screened for expression by whole mount in situ hybridization. We identified 10 novel expression patterns in the node and 5 in the definitive endoderm. We also found significant reduction of markers expressed in secondary tissues that require interaction with the organizer and its derivatives, such as cardiac mesoderm, vasculature, primitive streak, and anterior neuroectoderm. Conclusions: The genes identified in this screen represent novel Spemann/Mangold organizer genes as well as potential Foxa2 targets. Further investigation will be needed to define these genes as novel developmental regulatory factors involved in organizer formation and function. We have placed these genes in a Foxa2-dependent genetic regulatory network and we hypothesize how Foxa2 may regulate a molecular program of Spemann/Mangold organizer development. We have also shown how early loss of the organizer and its inductive properties in an otherwise normal embryo, impacts on the molecular profile of surrounding tissues. Experiment Overall Design: Microarrays: Experiment Overall Design: Tetraploid embryos were derived as previously described (Nagy et al. 1990; Nagy et al. 1993) using Foxa2 null ES cells (Dufort et al. 1998). Wild type embryos were collected from timed matings of ICR mice. Wild type or tetraploid embryos were collected at E7.5 and staged accordingly (Downs and Davies 1993). Embryos were between mid-streak and head-fold stages and the extra-embryonic regions were removed by dissection. The embryo proper, including extra-embryonic tetraploid-derived VE, was retained and multiple samples were pooled for total RNA isolation using Trizol reagent. Numbers of E7.5 embryos collected and pooled were as follows: wild type 1 (n=53), wild type 2 (n=50), Foxa2 null 1 (n=53), Foxa2 null 2 (n=48). Total RNA from each of the four embryo pools was processed for Affymetrix Murine Genome U74Av2 GeneChip analysis as previously described (Lickert et al. 2005). Experiment Overall Design: Data analysis: Experiment Overall Design: Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software was applied to the U74Av2 GeneChip data to target normalize the global expression level to 1000, and provide present, absent and fold change calls in a cross-comparisons of all replicate mutant samples over the two replicate wild-type samples. Next probe sets with absent calls in all samples were removed from the data set. As well, all samples with illogical calls were also removed, for example a probe set with an increase call that was called absent in the sample with the higher level of expression. Lastly, we filtered the data to include only probe sets that showed a statistical change call in two or more (2/4) of the cross comparisons. Experiment Overall Design: MOE430v2 GeneChips were analyzed as follows in the R statistical programming language (R Core Development Team, 2006; see Additional File 11 for details). Probeset summaries were calculated according to the MAS 5.0 algorithm. Logarithmic summary values were normalized by the loess smoother applied to the M-A scale transform. Statistical testing for differential expression between mutant and wild-type was performed on single probe level taking the duplicate chips into account employing the Wilcoxon paired rank test. The p-value threshold was adjusted by either family-wise error rate (FWER, Bonferroni procedure) or the false discovery rate (FDR, Bejamini-Hochberg technique). Significant probesets were tested for enrichment of GO terms by the hypergeometric distribution testing with the annotation as available from the GO consortium on March 25th, 2005."	"GEO"	"partial"

Of the top 100 genes exhibiting increased expression in the DMT, 29 were found to have been previously associated with tooth development. Differential expression of the remaining 71 genes not previously associated with tooth development was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis.

In the brain, loss of Dlx function results in defects in the production, migration and differentiation of GABAergic neurons, that can lead to epilepsy. In the branchial arches, loss of Dlx function leads to craniofacial malformations that include trigeminal axon pathfinding defects. To determine how these genes function, we wish to identify the transcriptional circuitry that lies downstream of these transcription factors by comparing gene expression in wild type with Dlx mutant CNS and craniofacial tissues. 1) Compare gene expression in the maxillay branch of the first branchial arch (BA) of E10.5 wild type and Dlx2 -/- mutants. 2) Compare gene expression in the maxillary branch of the first BA of E10.5 wild type and Dlx1/2 -/- mutants. 3) Compare gene expression in wild type maxillary and mandibular branchial arches. 4) Compare gene expressionin mandibular branch of Dlx5/6 -/- mutants with wild type mandibular branch. The Dlx transcription factors are essential for controlling patterning of the brain and craniofacial primordia. In the brain, they control differentiation of GABAergic neurons of the basal ganglia. In the branchial arches, they control regional patterning. I hypothesize that there will be some conserved and some divergent mechanisms that the Dlx genes use in controlling brain and craniofacial development. We have already performed array analyses on Dlx function in the developing basal ganglia (with TGEN) by comparing expressed genes in wild type and Dlx1/2 mutants. Here we will compare gene expression in the brachial arches of wild type and Dlx mutant mice. 1) Generate E10.5 mouse embryos that are either wild type, Dlx2-/-, Dlx1/2 -/- or Dlx5/6 -/-. 2) Determine genotype by PCR. 3) Dissect branchial arches from the different genotypes. 4) Separate maxillary and mandibular branch of each branchial arch. 5) Prepare total RNA from the specimens. Obtain sufficient tissue to obtain 10 ug of total RNA - based on previous experience we anticipate that this will require ~ 10 branchial arches.

Microarray analysis showed that genes involved in the following pathways were deregulated in different stages of tumorigenesis: S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases, metabolism, signal transduction, cell proliferation, cell adhesion and immune responses. This study reveals that GNMT plays an important role in the prevention of hapatotumorigenesis through regulating DNA methylaiton and oxidative stress signaling pathways. We postulate that GNMT is a stress-responsive protein and its expression may account for the gender difference of the susceptibility to liver cancer.

"GSE11165"	"Transcription of mouse wild type and GATA6 null lung"	"Epithelial organs including the lung are known to possess regenerative abilities through activation of endogenous stem cell populations but the molecular pathways regulating stem cell expansion and regeneration are not well understood. Here we show that Gata6 regulates the temporal appearance and number of bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs) in the lung leading to the precocious appearance of BASCs and concurrent loss in epithelial differentiation in Gata6 null lung epithelium. This expansion of BASCs is the result of a dramatic increase in canonical Wnt signaling in lung epithelium upon loss of Gata6. Expression of the non-canonical Wnt receptor Fzd2 is down-regulated in Gata6 mutants and increased Fzd2 or decreased -catenin expression rescues, in part, the lung epithelial defects in Gata6 mutants. During lung epithelial regeneration, we show that canonical Wnt signaling is activated in the niche containing BASCs and forced activation of Wnt signaling leads to a dramatic increase in BASC numbers. Moreover, Gata6 is required for proper lung epithelial regeneration and postnatal loss of Gata6 leads to increased BASC expansion and decreased differentiation. Together, these data demonstrate that Gata6 regulated Wnt signaling controls the balance between stem/progenitor expansion and epithelial differentiation required for both lung development and regeneration.

"#GSE11687"	"Transcription profiling of fertilized mouse eggs reveals Ca2+ oscillatory pattern in fertilized mouse eggs affects gene expression and development to term."	"The Ca2+ oscillations initiated by the fertilizing sperm (but terminating concomitant with pronucleus formation) apparently ensure that the events constituting egg activation occur in the correct temporal order; early events (e.g., cortical granule exocytosis) require fewer oscillations than later events (e.g., recruitment of maternal mRNA). Whether the Ca2+ signaling events impact long-term development, in particular development to term, is unknown. Using fertilized eggs that have undergone the first few Ca2+ oscillations, we developed procedures that result either in inhibiting or stimulating the natural pattern of Ca2+ signaling of inseminated eggs. Although the incidence of development to the blastocyst stage is unaltered by these procedures, fewer offspring are born following embryo transfer, indicating that developmental competence of the blastocysts is reduced. Interestingly, embryo transfer experiments reveal that when the natural regime of Ca2+ oscillations is precociously interrupted, the incidence of implantation is compromised whereas hyper-stimulation of Ca2+ signaling events compromises post-implantation development. Moreover, although there was no major difference in the overall growth rates of the offspring, those obtained following hyper-stimulation exhibited a far greater variability in their weight. Analysis of global patterns of gene expression by microarray analysis revealed that approximately 20% of the transcripts are mis-regulated when too few oscillations are experienced by the embryo and EASE analysis indicates that genes preferentially involved in RNA processing and polymerase II transcription are differentially affected. In addition, a set of genes involved in cell adhesion is also mis-expressed and could thus be mechanistically linked to the observed reduced implantation. Only about 3% of the transcripts were mis-regulated following hyper-stimulation, and EASE analysis indicates that genes preferentially involved in metabolism are differentially affected. In toto, these results indicate that a range Ca2+ signaling events following fertilization (an excess or reduction) has long-term effects on both gene expression and development to term. Experiment Overall Design: We profiled the global gene expression in the blastocysts by treatment of Ca2+ oscillations, and identified the genes differentially expressed."

Their expression is limited to immune cells and is tightly regulated. Cell surface expression of CD30 is restricted to subpopulations of activated T and B cells. CD30L is expressed primarily on activated T cells and subpopulations of B cells. The significance of CD30/CD30L interactions in immune regulation is not fully understood. Reported activities of CD30/CD30L in immune responses imply roles in regulation of secondary memory and antibody responses. Depending on the experimental system, both positive and negative regulation of immunoglobulin class switching and antibody production have been reported. Additionally, the biological activity of CD30/CD30L in animals has been difficult to assess due to the restricted and tightly regulated expression of this receptor-ligand pair. We generated transgenic mice with constitutive T cell specific overexpression of CD30L as a tool to help unravel the consequences of CD30/CD30L interactions in vivo. CD30L transgenic mice displayed a phenotype and responses to antigen challenge supporting a role for CD30/CD30L in promoting immunoglobulin class switching and antibody production. CD30L transgenic mice had increased numbers of germinal centers, elevated class-switched immunoglobulin isotypes, increased germinal center B cells and plasma cells, upregulation of genes indicative of B-cell activity, and exaggerated antibody responses to immune challenge. Interestingly, despite the heightened B-cell activity in CD30L transgenic mice, CD30L overexpression on T cells did not result in overt autoimmunity.

"E-MEXP-1333"	"Transcription profiling of brain from Cln1 and Cln5 deficient mice unravels common molecular pathways underlying neuronal degeneration in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses"	"The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) are a group of childhood inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by blindness, early dementia and pronounced cortical atrophy. The similar pathological and clinical profiles of different forms of NCL suggest that common disease mechanisms may be involved. Here, we have performed quantitative gene expression profiling of cortex from targeted knock out mice produced for Cln1 and Cln5 to explore NCL-associated molecular pathways. Combined microarray datasets from both mouse models exposed a common affected pathway: genes regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and neuronal growth cone stabilization display similar aberrations. We analyzed locus specific gene expression and showed regional clustering of Cln1 and three major genes of this pathway, further supporting a close functional relationship between the corresponding gene products, Cap1, Ptprf and Ptp4a2. The evidence from the gene expression data was substantiated by immunohistochemical staining data of Cln1-/- and Cln5-/- cortical neurons. These primary neurons displayed abnormalities in beta-tubulin and actin as well as abnormal intracellular distribution of growth cone associated proteins GAP-43, synapsin and Rab3. Our data provide the first evidence for a common molecular pathogenesis behind neuronal degeneration in CLN1 and CLN5. Since CLN1 and CLN5 code for proteins with distinct functional roles these data may have implications for other forms of NCL."	"ArrayExpress"	"partial"

Although chylomicrons are known to assemble in part within membrane secretory pathways, the modifications required for efficient vascular uptake are unknown. We report that the transcription factor Pleomorphic adenoma gene-like 2 (PLAGL2) is essential for this aspect of dietary lipid metabolism. PlagL2-/- mice die from post-natal wasting owing to failure of fat absorption. Lipids modified in the absence of PlagL2 exit from enterocytes but fail to enter interstitial lacteal vessels. Dysregulation of enterocyte genes closely linked to intracellular membrane transport identified candidate regulators of critical steps in chylomicron assembly. PlagL2 thus regulates essential and poorly understood aspects of dietary lipid absorption and its deficiency represents an authentic animal model with implications for amelioration of obesity or the metabolic syndrome. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was extracted from 4 knockout and 4 wild-type mouse small intestines at 18.5 dpc using the Macherey-Nagel Nucleospin kit. cRNA synthesis and labeling, hybridization to Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) MOE430 2.0 expression arrays, and data acquisition occurred on the Affymetrix GeneChip Instrument System."

The forkhead transcription factor FoxE3 is essential for maintenance, proliferation and survival of the epithelial cells, and silencing of the FoxE3 gene coincides with the cell cycle arrest that marks initiation of fiber cell differentiation. Here we have used transgenic ectopic expression of murine Foxe3 in fiber cells to investigate the consequences of persistent Foxe3 expression during fiber differentiation. Microarray transcript profiling showed that ectopic Foxe3 caused a general increase in mRNAs which are normally enriched in epithelial cells, consistent with an epithelialization of the transgenic fibers.

Cytokine profiling reveals a sustained increase in both Th1 and Th2 transcripts. Cellular populations of macrophages display an alternative phenotype, with upregulation of YM1, Arg1, Mrc1 as well as Class II MHC. These alternatively activated alveolar macrophages (AAAMs) also increase drastically in number. Subsequent challenge with house dust mite (HDM) Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus shows a reduced allergic phenotype, with decreased fold changes in effector cell cytokines of both the Th1 and Th2 variety indicative of the new regulatory environment established in the lung by helminth infection. Histological examination of the lung environment reveals a significant decrease in eosinophila and reduced mucous production by bronchial epithelial cells.

"GSE12881"	"Transcription profiling of mouse WT and Cav-3 knockouts on FVB/N genetic background mammary glands reveals loss of caveolin-3 induces the development of a lactogenic microenvironment"	"Here, we show that functional loss of a single gene is sufficient to confer constitutive milk protein production and protection against mammary tumor formation. Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in striated and smooth muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine if genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we next studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3 (-/-) null mice. Interestingly, detailed analysis of Cav-3 (-/-) virgin mammary glands shows dramatic increases in ductal thickness, side-branching, and the development of extensive lobulo-alveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Analysis by genome-wide expression profiling reveals the upregulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. The expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc are also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly show that Cav-3 (-/-) mice undergo precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic implantation of a transformed mammary cell line (known as Met-1), we demonstrate that virgin Cav-3 (-/-) mice are dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Interestingly, Cav-3 (+/-) mice also show similar protection, indicating that even reductions in Cav-3 levels are sufficient to render these mice resistant to tumorigenesis. Thus, Cav-3 (-/-) mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a constitutive lactogenic microenviroment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic micro-environment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers. Most importantly, a lactation-based therapeutic strategy would provide a more natural and nontoxic approach to the development of novel anti-cancer therapies. Experiment Overall Design: All WT and Cav-3 knockout (KO) mice used in this study were in the FVB/N genetic background. 4-month old virgin female mice were utilized in a micro array study between 3 wildtype and 3 Caveolin-3 knock-out mammary glands."

Little is known about the role of PPAR in the small intestine. Since this organ is frequently exposed to high levels of PPAR ligands via the diet, we set out to characterize the function of PPAR in small intestine using functional genomics experiments and bioinformatics tools. PPAR was expressed at high levels in both human and murine small intestine. Detailed analyses showed that PPAR was expressed highest in villus cells of proximal jejunum. Microarray analyses of total tissue samples revealed, that in addition to genes involved in fatty acid and triacylglycerol metabolism, transcription factors and enzymes connected to sterol and bile acid metabolism, including FXR and SREBP1, were specifically induced. In contrast, genes involved in cell cycle and differentiation, apoptosis, and host defense were repressed by PPAR activation. Additional analyses showed that intestinal PPAR dependent gene regulation occurred in villus cells. Functional implications of array results were corroborated by morphometric data. The repression of genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis was accompanied by a 22% increase in villus height, and a 34% increase in villus area of wild-type animals treated with WY14643. This is the first report providing a comprehensive overview of processes under control of PPAR in the small intestine. We show that PPAR is an important transcriptional regulator in small intestine, which may be of importance for the development of novel foods and therapies for obesity and inflammatory bowel diseases. Experiment Overall Design: Pure bred wild-type (129S1/SvImJ) and PPAR -null (129S4/SvJae) mice were treated with the synthetic PPAR ligand WY14,643 (0.1% w/w) for 5 days.

"GSE13010"	"Transcription profiling of mouse testes from C57BL/6 and AKR/N strains after heat shock"	"Cryptorchidism and scrotal heating result in abnormal spermatogenesis but the mechanism(s) proscribing this temperature sensitivity are unknown. It was previously reported that the AKR/N or MRL/MpJ-+/+ mouse testis is more heat resistant than the testis from the C57BL/6 strain. We have attempted to probe into the mechanism(s) involved in heat sensitivity by examining global gene expression profiles of normal and heat-treated testes from C57BL/6, AKR/N and MRL/MpJ-+/+ mice by microarray analysis. In the normal C57BL/6 testis, 415 and 416 transcripts were differentially expressed (at least two-fold higher or lower) when compared to the normal AKR/N and MRL/MpJ-+/+ testis, respectively. The AKR/N and MRL/MpJ-+/+ strains revealed 268 differentially expressed transcripts between them. There were 231 transcripts differentially expressed between C57BL/6 and two purported heat-resistant strains, AKR/N and MRL/MpJ-+/+. Next, the testes of C57BL/6 and AKR/N mice were exposed to 43 C for 15 min and harvested at different time points for TUNEL studies and microarrays. An increase of TUNEL-positive germ cell numbers was significant 8 hr after heat exposure in the C57BL/6 mouse. However, this increase was not observed in the AKR/N mouse until 10 hr after heat exposure. All tubules showed germ cell loss and disruption in C57BL/6 testis 24 hr after heat shock. In contrast, although a number of seminiferous tubules showed an abnormal morphology 24 hr post-heat shock in the AKR/N mouse, many tubules still retained a normal structure. Numerous transcripts exhibited differential regulation between the two strains within 24 hours after heat exposure. The differentially expressed transcripts in the testes 8 hr after heat exposure were targeted to identify the genes involved in the initial response rather than those due to germ cell loss. Twenty transcripts were significantly down-regulated and 19 genes were up-regulated by hyperthermia in C57BL/6 and did not show a parallel change in the AKR/N testis. Conversely, heat shock resulted in 30 up-regulated transcripts and 31 down-regulated transcripts in AKR/N that were not similarly regulated in C57BL/6. A number of genes shared similar differential expression patterns and differential regulation by hyperthermia in both strains of mice. Taken together, the present study indicates the diverse genetic backgrounds in the three strains lead to major differences in normal testis gene expression profiles while the differences in heat shock responses involves a significantly smaller number of genes. The data generated may provide insights regarding gene networks and pathways involved in heat stress and their relationship to spermatogenesis. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA of testes from two different strains of mice, C57BL/6 and AKR/N were analyzed using microarray 430.20 chip. Duplicates were used in controls and treated samples at 8hr, 10hr, 12hr, 24hr after heat shock at 43C for 15 min. All mice were 8 weeks old."	"GEO"	"partial"

The two forms of aSYN deposits, intracellular Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, are in the PD brain primarily found in the substantia nigra whereas in DLB brains they are diffusely spread in cortical and limbic areas. We are currently analyzing the protective effects on aSYN pathology by the molecular chaperone hsp70 in mice overexpressing wildtype human aSYN. Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing hsp70 have been cross-bred with the aSYN mouse line. Intriguingly, the aSYN / hsp70 double transgenics display a pronounced reduction in biochemically assessed aSYN aggregation. Gene expression of these mice will not only provide insight into the disease mechanisms of aSYN pathology but its prevention by the overexpression of hsp70, leading to new potential avenues of treatment. Project 1: To investigate and compare alterations in gene expression profiles of brains from wild-type mice and mice overexpressing wildtype human aSYN, human hsp70 and aSYN / hsp70, respectively. The comparison of the expression profiles of the groups of mice: aSYN, Hsp70, aSYN/ Hsp70 and non-transgenic littermates will help to identify the genes that are involved in the mediation of aggregation toxicity of aSYN expression as well as the genes that may mediate an attenuation of aSYN pathology in hsp70-coexpressors.

"GSE5658"	"Transcription profiling of mouse spinal and trigeminal sensory ganglia of Brn3a knockout and wild type mice reveals conserved and distinct regulatory targets of Brn3a at different levels of the sensory axis"	"General somatic sensation is conveyed to the central nervous system at cranial levels by the trigeminal ganglion (TG), and at spinal levels by the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Although these ganglia have similar functions, they have distinct embryological origins, in that both contain neurons originating from the neural crest, while only the TG includes cells derived from the placodal ectoderm. Here we use microarray analysis of E13.5 embryos to demonstrate that the developing DRG and TG have very similar overall patterns of gene expression. In mice lacking the POU-domain transcription factor Brn3a the DRG and TG exhibit many common changes in downstream gene expression, but a subset of genes show increased expression only at cranial levels. Although silent in wild-type ganglia, the promoter regions of genes which are activated in the absence of Brn3a also exhibit increased histone H3-acetylation at levels similar to constitutively transcribed gene loci, and this H3-acetylation is tissue-specific for genes which are increased only in the TG. These results demonstrate that one developmental role of Brn3a is to repress potential differences in gene expression between sensory neurons generated at different axial levels, and to regulate a convergent program of developmental gene expression, in which functionally similar populations of neurons are generated from different embryological substrates. Experiment Overall Design: Microarrays used to compare the patterns of gene expression in the dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal ganglia of Brn3a knockout and wild-type mice. Embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) was chosen because at this point in development mutant mice exhibit major defects in sensory axon growth, but have yet to undergo the period of extensive sensory neuron death associated with later stages."

We have now successfully generated NR3B null mice. Interestingly, NR3B-null mice invariably die at age P4-P8. Our preliminary examination indicates that the motor strength of these mice is severely impaired prior to death. As we continue to explore the cause of death in NR3B null mice, we propose to conduct gene profiling experiments to search for transcription changes in the brain related to ablation of the NR3B gene. We have used the facility provided by the NINDS/NIMH Microarray Consortium to identify genes that show abnormal expression patterns in these mice. We would like to compare these changes with that opccured in SOD1 mice, a mouse model of motor neuron diseases. Analysis of these genes will help to identify changes in networks and pathways that may cause the death of NR3B-null mice. These studies will further help to elucidate the functional role of NR3B in motor neurons. We will compare samples from motor neurons of wild type and SOD1 mice to identify genes that show abnormal expression patterns, which may be implicated in the death of SOD1 mice and shared with the same changes in NR3B-null mice. We hypothesize that genes with their transcription level changing significantly in SOD1 mutant mice will be associated with the molecular mechanism underlying the death of motor neurons. We like to compare motor neuron and spinal cord smaples from SOD1 mice at the age prior to the disease onset. Total RNA from total 9 samples will be purified, each from ~200 motor neurons obtained by Laser Capture Microdissection and the total spinal cord.

Mice lacking either of these factors have a largely normal early B cell development. However, when both factors are eliminated simultaneously a block is uncovered at the transition between pre-B and immature B cells, indicating that these proteins exert a critical function in developing B lymphocytes. In mice deficient for Aiolos and OBF-1, the numbers of immature B cells are reduced, small pre-BII cells are increased and a significant impairment in immunoglobulin light chain DNA rearrangement is observed. We identified genes whose expression is deregulated in the pre-B cell compartment of these mice. In particular, we found that components of the pre-BCR, such as the surrogate light chain genes l5l5 and VpreB, fail to be efficiently silenced in double-mutant mice. Strikingly, developmentally regulated nuclear repositioning of the l5l5 gene is impaired in pre-B cells lacking OBF-1 and Aiolos. These studies uncover a novel role for OBF-1 and Aiolos in controlling the transcription and nuclear organization of genes involved in pre-BCR function.

"GSE8227"	"Transcription profiling of mouse back skin fromK14-DN-Clim"	"The homeostasis of both cornea and hair follicles depends on a constant supply of progeny cells produced by populations of keratin (K) 14-expressing stem cells localized in specific niches. To investigate the potential role of Co-factors of LIM domains (Clims) in such tissues, we generated transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative Clim molecule (DN-Clim) under the control of the K14 promoter. As expected, the K14 promoter directed high level expression of the transgene to the basal cells of cornea and epidermis, as well as the outer root sheath of hair follicles. In corneal epithelium, the transgene expression causes decreased expression of adhesion molecule BP180 and defective hemidesmosomes, leading to detachment of corneal epithelium from the underlying stroma, which in turn causes blisters, wounds and an inflammatory response. After a period of epithelial thinning, the corneal epithelium undergoes differentiation to an epidermis-like structure. The K14-DN-Clim mice also develop progressive hair loss due to dysfunctional hair follicles that fail to generate hair shafts. The number of hair follicle stem cells is decreased by at least 50% in K14-DN-Clim mice, indicating that Clims are required for hair follicle stem cell maintenance. We hypothesize that Clim2 is an essential co-factor for the LIM homeodomain factor Lhx2, which was previously shown to play a role in hair follicle stem cell maintenance. Together, these data indicate that Clim proteins play important roles in the homeostasis of corneal epithelium and hair follicles. Experiment Overall Design: We profiled mRNA expression in mouse back skin from 3 time points, representing the initial hair follicle morphogenesis (P6 and P14) and the first telogen (P23); hair growth is synchronized during these time points.

In this regenerating tissue, progenitors differentiate continually into 4 principal specialized cell types, yet underlying mechanisms of differentiation are poorly understood. We identified stomach-restricted expression of the forkhead transcription factor FOXQ1. Methods: We used a combination of genetic, histochemical, ultrastructural and molecular analysis to study gastric cell lineages with respect to FOXQ1. Results: Within the developing and adult gastrointestinal tract, Foxq1 mRNA is restricted to the stomach, expressed prominently in foveolar (pit) cells, the abundant mucin-producing cells that line the mucosal surface, and required for their complete differentiation. Mice carrying Foxq1 coding mutations show virtual absence of mRNA and protein for the backbone of the predominant stomach mucin, MUC5AC. These observations correspond to a paucity of foveolar-cell secretory vesicles and notable loss of stomach but not intestinal mucus. Transcriptional profiling identified a surprisingly restricted set of genes with altered expression in Foxq1 mutant stomachs. MUC5AC is a highly tissue-restricted product that similarly depends on FOXQ1 in its other major site of expression, conjunctival goblet cells. Conclusions: Taken together, these observations imply that promotion of gastric MUC5AC synthesis is a primary, cell-autonomous function of FOXQ1. This study is the first to implicate a transcription factor in terminal differentiation of foveolar cells and begins to define the requirements to assemble highly specialized organelles and cells in the gastric mucosa.

"GSE12446"	"Transcription profiling of human hormone-treated postmenopausal patients"	"Title: Transcriptome analysis of human endometrial tissues from healthy post-menoupausal women reflecting the endometrial response to 3-weeks treatment with tibolone, E2 and E2+MPA. In an observational, open, non-randomized, controlled study uterine tissues were collected in order to generate endometrial gene expression profiles. healthy postmenopausal women were enrolled into the following treatment groups: Control-group; Tibolone-group, 2,5 mg of tibolone (administered orally) every day, starting 21 days prior to surgery; Estradiol-group, 2 mg of estradiol (administered orally) every day, starting 21 days prior to surgery; Estradiol+progestagen-group, 2 mg of estradiol (administered orally) and 5 mg of MPA (Medroxy Progesteroneacetate, administered orally) every day, starting 21 days prior to surgery. Pure (100%) endometrium was isolated from the snap-frozen uterine tissues and used for RNA isolation. RNA was labbeled and hybridized to whole genome Affymetrix U133plus2 GeneChips containing 54,614 probe sets, representing approximately 47,000 transcripts. Relative to the control group, 940 genes are regulated in the endometrium of E2 treated patients, whereas only 198 genes are significantly regulated in endometria from tibolone or E2+MPA treated patients. Furthermore, only 9% of E2 regulated genes are also regulated by tibolone (85 out of 940), only 5% are also regulated by E2+MPA treatment and the overlap between tibolone and E2+MPA treatment is about 10%. This indicated that tibolone-treatment results in a weak endometrial profile similarity to E2 treatment and no profile similarity to E2+MPA treatment. A more detailed analysis showed that down stream processes, such as regulation of the cell cycle, angiogenesis and cell proliferation are almost not affected by tibolone treatment but, in contrast, are significantly affected by E2. For example, upon staining with Ki67, a marker for mitotic activity, significantly increased stromal as well as glandular cell proliferation was observed in the endometria from the E2-only treated group, while tibolone treatment resulted only in a slight increase in stromal cell proliferation (and no increase in glandular cell proliferation). These results indicate that in contrast to long-term tibolone use, short-term (21-days) use results in some estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium, which is clearly far less and rather different from what is observed during E2 treatment.

"GSE6565"	"Transcription profiling of 18-22 week human distal femur fetal cartilage and compared with a database of control normal human tissues from the CELSIUS database"	"Cartilage plays a fundamental role in the development of the human skeleton. Early in embryogenesis, mesenchymal cells condense and differentiate to chondrocytes to shape the early skeleton. Subsequently, the cartilage anlagen differentiate to form the growth plates, which are responsible for linear bone growth, and the articular chondrocytes, which facilitate joint function. However, despite the multiplicity of roles of cartilage during human fetal life, surprisingly little is known about its transcriptome. To address this, a whole genome microarray expression profile was generated using RNA isolated from 18-22 week human distal femur fetal cartilage and compared with a database of control normal human tissues aggregated at UCLA, termed CELSIUS. From the wealth of data, 161 cartilage-selective genes were identified, defined as genes significantly expressed in cartilage with low expression and little variation across a panel of 34 non-cartilage tissues. Among these 161 genes were cartilage-specific genes such as collagen genes and 25 genes which have been associated with skeletal phenotypes in humans and/or mice. Many of the other cartilage-selective genes do not have established roles in cartilage or are novel, unannotated genes. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the unique pattern of gene expression observed by microarray analysis. Defining the gene expression pattern for cartilage has identified new genes that may contribute to human skeletogenesis as well as provided further candidate genes for skeletal dysplasias. The data suggest that fetal cartilage is a complex and transcriptionally active tissue and demonstrate that the set of genes selectively expressed in the tissue has been greatly underestimated. Experiment Overall Design: RNA from 7 normal fetal cartilage samples was isolated. 5 samples were run in duplicate on U133 2.0 arrays, while 2 were run on U133A and U133B subsets. In brief, cartilage selective genes were identified by comparing 5 normal cartilage samples (GSM149638,GSM149639 ,GSM149640,GSM149641 ,GSM149642) to normal tissue expression profiles found on CELCIUS at UCLA. Genes which were found expressed at significantly higher levels were validated for their elevated and specific expression using the three platforms.

"GSE13205"	"Transcription profiling of skeletal muscle form patients suffering from sepsis-induced muliple organ failure"	"Septic patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) often develop multiple organ failure including persistent skeletal muscle dysfunction which results in the patient s protracted recovery process. We have demonstrated that muscle mitochondrial enzyme activities are impaired in septic ICU patients resulting in decreased cellular energy which will interfere with muscle function and metabolism. Here we use detailed phenotyping and genomics to elucidate mechanisms leading to these impairments. Methodology/Principle Findings Utilising biopsy material from seventeen patients and ten age-matched controls we demonstrate that neither mitochondrial in vivo protein synthesis nor expression of mitochondrial genes are compromised. Indeed, there was partial activation of the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway involving NRF2?/GABP and its target genes TFAM, TFB1M and TFB2M yet clearly this failed to maintain mitochondrial function. We therefore utilised transcript profiling and pathway analysis of ICU patient skeletal muscle to generate insight into the molecular defects driving loss of muscle function and metabolic homeostasis. Gene ontology analysis of Affymetrix analysis demonstrated substantial loss of muscle specific genes, a global oxidative stress response related to most probably cytokine signalling, altered insulin related signalling and a substantial overlap between patients and muscle wasting/inflammatory animal models. MicroRNA 21 processing appeared defective suggesting that post-transcriptional protein synthesis regulation is altered by disruption of tissue microRNA expression. Finally, we were able to demonstrate that the phenotype of skeletal muscle in ICU patients is not merely one of inactivity, it appears to be an actively remodelling tissue, influenced by several mediators, all of which may be open to manipulation with the aim to improve clinical outcome. Conclusions/Significance This first combined protein and transcriptome based analysis of human skeletal muscle obtained from septic patients demonstrated that losses of mitochondria and muscle mass are accompanied by sustained protein synthesis (anabolic process) while dysregulation of transcription programmes appears to fail to compensate for increased damage and proteolysis. Our analysis identified both validated and novel clinically tractable targets to manipulate these failing processes and pursuit of these could lead to new potential treatments.

"GSE12034"	"Transcription profiling of human oocytes"	"The identification of genes and deduced pathways from the mature human oocyte can help us better understand oogenesis, folliculogenesis, fertilization, and embryonic development. Human metaphase II oocytes were used within minutes after removal from the ovary, and its transcriptome was compared with a reference sample consisting of a mixture of total RNA from 10 different normal human tissues not including the ovary. RNA amplification was performed by using a unique protocol. Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip arrays were used for hybridizations. Compared with reference samples, there were 5,331 transcripts significantly up-regulated and 7,074 transcripts significantly down-regulated in the oocyte. Of the oocyte up-regulated probe sets, 1,430 have unknown function. A core group of 66 transcripts was identified by intersecting significantly up-regulated genes of the human oocyte with those from the mouse oocyte and from human and mouse embryonic stem cells. GeneChip array results were validated using RT-PCR in a selected set of oocyte-specific genes. Within the up-regulated probe sets, the top overrepresented categories were related to RNA and protein metabolism, followed by DNA metabolism and chromatin modification. This report provides a comprehensive expression baseline of genes expressed in in vivo matured human oocytes. Further understanding of the biological role of these genes may expand our knowledge on meiotic cell cycle, fertilization, chromatin remodeling, lineage commitment, pluripotency, tissue regeneration, and morphogenesis. Experiment Overall Design: We generated a database of the human oocyte transcriptome by comparing the transcripts in the oocyte with the reference samples, which contain mRNA from several somatic tissues. Experiment Overall Design: Human oocytes were obtained from three patients undergoing an assisted reproductive treatment (ART) at the Unit of Reproductive Medicine of Clinica Las Condes, Santiago, Chile. It is important to emphasize that the routine in vitro fertilization protocol at Clinica Las Condes calls for fertilizing only those oocytes that will be transferred into the uterus of the patient. Therefore, there is always a surplus of oocytes. We then had the opportunity to use specific criteria to select donors as follows: (i) <35 years old, (ii) reproductively healthy with regular ovulatory cycles, (iii) male factor as the only cause of infertility, and (iv) considerable number of developing follicles that assured spared oocytes. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by a local independent Ethics Review Board. All donors signed informed consent. At the time this manuscript was submitted, all three donors had already conceived; two of them got pregnant during the ART cycle in which our samples were collected, and the third one got pregnant after a spontaneous cycle with artificial insemination using donated sperm. Ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval, and cell lysis were performed as described in Supporting Materials and Methods, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site. Experiment Overall Design: Three groups of 10 oocytes each were used. Reference RNA (100 g) was prepared by mixing 10 g of total RNA from each of 10 different normal human tissues, including skeletal muscle, kidney, lung, colon, liver, spleen, breast, brain, heart, and stomach (Ambion).

"GSE6344"	"Transcription profiling of human stage 1,2 normal and tumor kidney cancer"	"Although renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the sixth-leading cause of cancer death, the molecular events leading to disease onset and progression are not well understood. Genomic profiling of clear cell RCC (cRCC) patients indicated that loss of a negative regulator of the Wnt pathway, secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1), occurred in the majority of more than 100 patients tested. To our knowledge, this is the first report of loss of sFRP1 expression in patients diagnosed with cRCC; this loss occurs in early stage cRCC, suggesting that it may be an important early event in renal carcinogenesis. Genomic profiling of patient matched normal and cRCC tissues identified Wnt regulated genes to be aberrantly increased in cRCC tissues suggesting sFRP1 suppresses Wnt signaling in cRCC. In order to test the hypothesis that sFRP1 acts as a tumor suppressor in cRCC, we have stably expressed sFRP1 in cRCC cells. sFRP1 expression in cRCC cells resulted in decreased growth in cell culture, inhibition of anchorage-independent growth, and decreased tumor volume in a nude mouse model. Together these data suggest an important role for sFRP1 as a tumor suppressor in cRCC.

"GSE11971"	"Transcription profiling of human muscles from untreated children with juvenile dermatomyositis"	"Background :To evaluate the impact of the duration of chronic inflammation on gene expression in skeletal muscle biopsies (MBx) from untreated children with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) and identify genes and biological processes associated with the disease progression, expression profiling data from 16 girls with active symptoms of JDM greater or equal to 2 months were compared with 3 girls with active symptoms less than 2 months. Results: Seventy-nine genes were differentially expressed between the groups with long or short duration of untreated disease. Genes involved in immune responses and vasculature remodeling were expressed at a higher level in muscle biopsies from children with greater or equal to 2 months of symptoms, while genes involved in stress responses and protein turnover were expressed at a lower level. Among the 79 genes, expression of 9 genes showed a significant linear regression relationship with the duration of untreated disease. Five differentially expressed genes--HLA-DQA1, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, clustering, plexin D1 and tenomodulin--were verified by quantitative RT-PCR. The chronic inflammation of longer disease duration was also associated with increased DC-LAMP+ and BDCA2+ mature dendritic cells, identified by immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: We conclude that chronic inflammation alters the gene expression patterns in muscle of untreated children with JDM. Symptoms lasting greater or equal to 2 months were associated with dendritic cell maturation and anti-angiogenic vascular remodelling, directly contributing to disease pathophysiology. Experiment Overall Design: After obtaining informed consent, 23 girls with definite JDM were enrolled in this study prior to obtaining the MRI directed diagnostic muscle biopsy.

"#GSE11768"	"Transcription profiling of mouse (nude) model of endometriosis"	"The pathophysiology of endometriotic lesion development remains unclear but involves a complex interaction between ectopic endometrium and host peritoneal tissues. We hypothesised that disruption of this interaction was likely to suppress endometriotic lesion formation. We hoped to delineate the molecular and cellular dialogue between ectopic human endometrium and peritoneal tissues in nude mice, as a first step towards testing this hypothesis. Human endometrium was xenografted into nude mice and the resulting lesions were analysed using microarrays. A novel technique was developed that unambiguously determined whether RNA transcripts identified by the microarray analyses originated from human cells (endometrium) or mouse cells (stroma). Four key pathways (ubiquitin/proteosome, inflammation, tissue remodelling/repair and ras-mediated oncogenesis) were revealed, that demonstrated communication between host stromal cells and ectopic endometrium. Morphometric analysis of nude mouse lesions confirmed that necrosis, inflammation, healing and repair and cell proliferation occurred during xenograft development. These processes were entirely consistent with the molecular networks revealed by the microarray data. The transcripts detected in the xenografts overlapped with transcripts differentially expressed in a comparison between paired eutopic and ectopic endometrium from human endometriotic patients. For the first time components of the interaction between ectopic endometrium and peritoneal stromal tissues have been revealed in ectopic endometrial lesions. Targeted disruption of this dialogue is likely to disrupt endometriotic tissue formation and may prove to be an effective therapeutic strategy for endometriosis.

Using the HG-U133 Plus 2.0 expression array from Affymetrix, we analyzed gene expression in skeletal muscle from obese women with PCOS (n=16) and age- and body mass index-matched control women (n=13) metabolically characterized by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and indirect calorimetry. To identify pathways of importance for the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in PCOS, we performed biological pathway analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA 1.0) and Gene Microarray Pathway Profiler (GenMAPP 2.0). The expression of 9 genes, selected according to biological relevance, was evaluated by quantitative real time PCR (q-RT-PCR). Women with PCOS were characterized by fasting hyperinsulinemia and impaired insulin-stimulated glucose disposal - caused by reduced glucose oxidation and storage - as well as impaired suppression of lipid oxidation (all P<0.01). GSEA and GenMAPP both revealed the same set of genes involved in OXPHOS, which was also the most downregulated biological pathway (P<0.01). These results were confirmed by q-RT-PCR of six genes from the OXPHOS gene set as well as three transcription factors known to regulate the transcription of these genes. Our results, for the first time, provide evidence for an association between insulin resistance and impaired mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle in women with PCOS.

"GSE6011"	"Transcription profiling of human quadriceps muscle of young Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients and age matched controls"	"Albeit increased serum CK level and abnormal muscle histology are always present, boys with DMD are phenotipically indistinguishable from the normal ones at birth and, in their first years of life, acquire early motor milestones at normal times. A clear defect in muscle function becomes generally apparent by the end of the second year. As the disease is typically diagnosed between the ages of 3 and 7, the first two years are often considered and referred to as clinically presymptomatic. As a defined gene expression signature was shown to characterize these symptomatic patients we sought to investigate whether and to which extent alterations may be also present in muscle from presymptomatic DMD infants. To this aim, we used the Affymetrix technology to compare the individual expression profiles of 19 DMD patients with age at biopsy scattered along the first two years of the disease with those of 14 age matched controls. This approach allowed us to describe with high resolution the altered transcriptional state that characterizes this early, presymptomatic phase of the disease and highlight some molecular pathways as potential critical targets in the pathophysiology of the disease. Experiment Overall Design: -Subjects Experiment Overall Design: Relevant data about the participants are posted under supplementary material (Table ST1). All DMD patients (n=22) had diagnosis of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy based on the absence of dystrophin immunoreactivity on quadriceps muscle sections. None of the participants at the time of biopsy was or had been under corticosteroid treatment. Control biopsies (n=14) were selected from diagnostic specimens which were not given a diagnosis of neuromuscular disease nor showed any non-specific myopathic signs. A MIAME compliant description of this study is posted under supplementary Material (MIAME compliance). Experiment Overall Design: -RNA extraction. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was extracted from frozen quadriceps muscle biopsies by TriZol. (TriZol reagent, Invitrogen). RNA was further purified using the RNAeasy mini kit following the RNA cleanup protocol as indicated by the manufacturer (QIAGEN). RNA purity and integrity was assessed by spectophotometric analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. Experiment Overall Design: -Affymetrix Genechips. Experiment Overall Design: In this work we made use of one chip type: the affymetrix HG-U133A genechipCRNA synthesis was performed using 5ug of total RNA as template, as described in the Affymetrix Gene Expression Manual. Genechips were washed and stained in an Affymetrix fluidic station 430.

"GSE9984"	"Transcription profiling of human placentae of different gestational ages: an opru network and uw scor study"	"We used a whole genome approach to identify major functional gene categories (including xenobiotic transporters and metabolizing enzymes) whose expression depends on gestational age. STUDY DESIGN: We compared gene expression profiles of 1st (45-59 days) and 2nd trimester (109-115 days), and C-section term placentae. RESULTS: In 1st trimester placentae, genes related to cell cycle, DNA, aminoacids and carbohydrate metabolism were significantly overrepresented, while genes related to signal transduction were downregulated. In the organism defense category, we identified genes involved in chemical response, metabolism, and transport. Analysis of signal transduction pathways suggested, and subsequently confirmed independently, that the Wnt pathway was regulated by gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: Our study will serve as a reference database to gain insight into the regulation of gene expression in the developing placentae and, thus, allow comparisons with placentae from complicated pregnancies such as those in women experiencing gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and teratogenic sequelae.

High-risk populations include women with diabetes, dyslipidemia, thrombotic disorders, hyperhomocysteinemia, hypertension, renal diseases, previous preeclampsia, twin pregnancies, and low socioeconomic status. In the latter case, the incidence may increase to 20% to 25%. Preeclampsia is a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia is defined by systolic blood pressure of more than 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of more than 90 mm Hg after 20 weeks gestation in a previously normotensive patient, and new-onset proteinuria. Abnormal placentation associated with shallow trophoblast invasion (fetal cells from outer cell layer of the blastocyst) into endometrium (decidua) and improper spiral artery remodeling in the decidua are initial pathological steps. In this study we analyzed the renin-angiotensin system in adipose tissue, decidua and placenta from women with uneventful pregnancy and women with preeclampsia. We also analyzed the tissue by Affymetrix chips in a comparison study (control vs. preeclampsia) Experiment Overall Design: 6 affymetrix human expression chips (GPL570) were analyzed. Experiment Overall Design: They represent 3 tissues (pooled from 10 individuals each) from patients with preeclampsia and from patients with uneventful pregnancy (collected by cesaraen section).

By comparing the gene expression profiles of similar but distinctive mental disorders, we explored the uniqueness of bipolar disorder and its similarity to other mental disorders at the molecular level. Notably, most of the altered gene expressions in each disease were not shared by one another, suggesting the molecular distinctiveness of these mental disorders. We found a tendency of downregulation of the genes encoding receptor, channels or transporters, and upregulation of the genes encoding stress response proteins or molecular chaperons in bipolar disorder. Altered expressions in bipolar disorder shared by other mental disorders mainly consisted of upregulation of the genes encoding proteins for transcription or translation. The genes identified in this study would be useful for the understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, as well as the common pathophysiological background in major mental disorders at the molecular level.

We sought the specific gene sets responsible for initiating term and preterm labor, along with a core set of effector genes necessary for labor independent of gestational age and the underlying trigger. The Effector Gene Set consisted of 49 genes present in both preterm and term labor but absent from non-labor samples. 122 genes were specific to preterm labor (Preterm Initiator Set) and 229 to term labor (Term Initiator Set). The Term Initiator and the Effector Sets reflected predominantly inflammatory processes. Surprisingly, the Preterm Initiator Gene Set reflected molecular and biological events almost exclusive of inflammation. Preterm and term labor differ dramatically in their unique, initiator gene profiles, suggesting alternative pathways underlie these events. Inflammatory processes are ubiquitous to the Term Initiator and the Effector Gene Sets, supporting the idea term parturition is an inflammatory process. The absence of inflammatory processes in the Preterm Initiator Set suggests inflammation is secondary to processes triggering spontaneous preterm birth, and could explain the lack of therapeutic efficacy associated with anti inflammatory/antibiotic regimens. Experiment Overall Design: Myometrial gene expression was analyzed from samples obtained at term (n=6) or preterm (n=6) with and without labor using cDNA microarrays. Patients in preterm labor all had intra amniotic inflammation. Gene sets were generated using logical operations within a functional mapping tool (MetaCore , GeneGo, St. Joseph, MI).

"GSE12021"	"Transcription profiling of human rheumatoid arthritis patients to identify inter-individual and gene-specific variance in the synovial membrane"	"Background. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory and destructive joint disease, characterized by overexpression of pro-inflammatory/-destructive genes and other activating genes (e.g., proto-oncogenes) in the synovial membrane (SM). The gene expression in disease is often characterized by significant inter-individual variances via specific synchronization/ desynchronization of gene expression. To elucidate the contribution of the variance to the pathogenesis of disease, expression variances were tested in SM samples of RA patients, osteoarthritis (OA) patients, and normal controls (NC). Results. For the comparison between RA and NC, 568 genes with significantly different variances in the 2 groups (p < 0.05; Bonferroni/Holm corrected Brown-Forsythe version of the Levene-Test) were selected. For the comparison between RA and OA, 333 genes were selected. Using the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), 10 pathways/complexes significantly affected by higher gene expression variances were identified in RA compared to NC, including cytokine cytokine receptor interactions, the TGF-pathway, and anti-apoptosis. Compared to OA, 3 pathways with significantly higher variances were identified in RA (e.g., B cell receptor signaling, VEGF signaling). Functionally, the majority of the identified pathways is involved in the regulation of inflammation, proliferation, cell survival, and angiogenesis. Conclusion. In RA, a number of disease-relevant or even disease-specific pathways/complexes are characterized by broad intra-group, inter-individual expression variances. This indicates that RA pathogenesis in different individuals may depend to a lesser extent on common alterations of the expression of specific key genes, but on individual-specific alterations of different genes resulting in common disturbances of key pathways. Experiment Overall Design: Expression variances were tested in synovial membrane samples of rheumatoid arthritis patients, osteoarthritis patients, and normal controls (see publication for further details)."

"The molecular basis of breast cancer invasion and metastasis is not well understood. Our objective was to analyze transcriptome differences between stromal and epithelial cells in normal breast tissue and invasive breast cancer to define the role stroma plays in invasion. Total RNA was isolated from epithelial and stromal cells that were laser captured from normal breast tissue (n=5) and invasive breast cancer (n=28). Gene expression was measured using Affymetrix U133A 2.0 GeneChips. Differential gene expression was evaluated and compared within a model that accounted for cell type (epithelial [E] versus stromal [S]), diagnosis (cancer [C] versus normal [N]) as well as cell type-diagnosis interactions. Compared to NE, the CE transcriptome was highly enriched with genes in proliferative, motility and ECM ontologies. Differences in CS and NS transcriptomes suggested that the ECM was being remodeled in invasive breast cancer, as genes were over-represented in ECM and proteolysis ontologies. Genes more highly expressed in CS compared to CE were primarily ECM components or were involved in the remodeling of ECM, suggesting that ECM biosynthesis and remodeling were initiated in the tumor stromal compartment. Experiment Overall Design: Breast tissue was collected at surgery from patients undergoing surgical resection for invasive breast cancer (n=28) and reduction mammoplasty (n=5). Tissue was cryopreserved in OCT and serial sections were cut using a cryostat. Sections were stained and epithelial and stromal cells were isolated by laser capture microdissection.

Information about the genes that are preferentially expressed in relationship to normal neurological aging could provide new information about the molecular mechanisms that are involved in normal age-related cognitive decline and a host of age-related neurological disorders, and they could provide novel targets for the discovery of interventions to mitigate some of these deleterious effects. Aim 1. Collect brain samples from three Alzheimer s Disease Centers (ADCs) for subsequent gene expression profiling. Individuals will be stratified with respect to diagnostic groups (using both clinical and neuropathological criteria), age groups, and APOE genotype. 150 individual brains will be sampled from the Arizona ADC, the Duke University ADC, and the Washington University ADC. Miniscule sample sizes (200 um of sectioned tissue) from six brain regions that are histopathologically or metabolically relevant to AD and aging will be collected, ensuring that this proposal does not deplete the national resource. Frozen and fixed samples will be sent to Phoenix, sectioned in a standardized fashion, and then returned. Aim 2. Tissue heterogeneity will be eliminated prior to expression profiling by performing laser capture microscopy on all brain regions. Aim 3. Expression profile LCM-captured cells on the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array (~55,000 transcripts), and quickly provide these data to the community at large. Aim 4. Identify pathogenic cascades related to each of the clinico-pathologic correlates using unsupervised and supervised analyses coupled with a hypothesis-driven approach. Aim 5. Validation of the expression correlates at the protein and functional levels. Scientific progress in the last few years has improved our understanding of AD and raised the hope of identifying treatments to halt the progression and prevent the onset of this disorder. For instance, researchers have begun to characterize the cascade of molecular events which lead to the major histopathological features of the disorder: neuritic plaques, which contain extra-cellular deposits of amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta); neurofibrillary tangles, which contain the hyperphosphorylated form of the intracellular, microtubule-associated protein, tau; and a loss of neurons and synapses. These molecular events provide targets for the development of promising new treatments. For example, A-beta has been postulated to trigger a cascade of events that are involved in the pathogenesis of AD. This proposal hopes to provide new information about the genes that are preferentially expressed in the development of AD histopathology, including the over-expression of APP, amyloid-induced neurotoxicity, and hyperphosphorylation of tau, as well as bring clarity to the metabolic abnormalities that seem to play a role in dementia and AD development and pathology. We will perform LCM on 6 brain regions with about 14 biological replicates per brain region. The brain regions are as follows: 1) entorhinal cortex 2) hippocampus 3) medial temporal gyrus 4) posterior cingulate 5) superior frontal gyrus and 6) primary visual cortex.

However, the limited and often conflicting information available from healthy populations makes it difficult to confirm these differences. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate and compare changes in gene expression associated with age and gender in the human parotid gland. Differential expression, defined as statistically significant differences with at least 1.5 fold changes, was detected using the Affymetrix GeneChip HGU133plus2.0 microarray in 787 gene probe sets; 320 showed higher expression in males, while 467 showed higher expression in females. Several genes associated with saliva secretion were differentially expressed in male and female parotid gland including vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 VAMP3, synaptosomal-associated protein SNAP23, RAS oncogene family member RAB1A, syntaxin binding protein STXBP1. When the gene expression results from the youngest (19-38 years old) and the oldest (65-69 years old) female subjects were further evaluated, it was found that the expression of 228 genes were altered during aging; 155 genes were down-regulated, whereas 73 genes were up-regulated in the female parotid gland. Of the genes that were altered during aging, 24 of the 28 genes (86%) classified as being associated with immune responses were down-regulated in the aged parotid gland. A panel of differentially expressed, age- and gender-related genes was selected for further study by quantitative, real-time RT-PCR. Comparable differences in gene expression were detected by both Affymetrix array and quantitative, real-time RT-PCR methods. Taken together, our data suggest that salivary gland function may be adversely affected in the aged population due, at least in part, to the down regulation of several categories of genes. Moreover, the gender specific gene expressions identified in the present study correlates with the previously observed sexual dimorphism in salivary gland function.

Presenilins are intramembrane polytopic proteases. These proteases are critical proteins in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The function of other polytopic proteases expressed in brains is unknown. Proteins that may potentially interact with PS pathway are of interest to elucidate. In this project we will determine gene expression patterns in the brains of mice with altered expression of polytopic protease. We hypothesize that family of polytopic proteases expressed in brain may potentially interact with presenilin pathway.

"GSE8027"	"Transcription profiling of mouse Dll3 and Notch1 homozygous mutant embryos to investigate craniofacial malformations of human birth defects"	"Mutations in the Notch1 receptor and delta-like 3 (Dll3) ligand cause global disruptions in axial segmental patterning. Genetic interactions between members of the notch pathway have previously been shown to cause patterning defects not observed in single gene disruptions. We examined Dll3-Notch1 compound mouse mutants to screen for potential gene interactions. While mice heterozygous at either locus appeared normal, 30% of Dll3-Notch1 double heterozygous animals exhibited localized, stochastic segmental anomalies similar to human congenital vertebral defects. Unexpectedly, double heterozygous mice also displayed statistically significant decreases in mandibular height and elongated maxillary hard palate. Examination of somite-stage embryos and perinatal anatomy and histology did not reveal any organ defects, so we used microarray-based analysis of Dll3 and Notch1 mutant embryos to identify gene targets that may be involved in notch-regulated segmental or craniofacial development. Therefore, Dll3-Notch1 double heterozygous mice model human congenital scoliosis and craniofacial disorders. Experiment Overall Design: Given the reduced penetrance and stochastic nature of the segmental and craniofacial defects in Dll3-Notch1 double heterozygous animals, we next sought to identify candidate genes that may be down or up-regulated in Dll3 and Notch1 homozygous mutant embryos during development of these structures. We carried out microarray analysis using Affymetrix MOE430 microarrays, comparing 9.5 dpc homozygous embryos in duplicate to littermates with wild-type alleles at both loci, and comparing with heterozygous littermate embryos. Affymetrix analysis software (Microarray Suite 5.0) was used to determine whether gene probes were present, marginal or absent. Probes with present flags in replicates of Dll3, Notch1, or embryos with wild-type alleles at both loci were considered present for further analysis. Altogether, out of 22,690 probe sets on the MOE430A array, we identified 12,820 probes that were present in replicates of at least one genotypic group. To identify genes that were increased or decreased in expression in mutant embryos, we carried out robust multichip average (RMA) normalization of microarray data sets using the RMA module of Genespring GX 7.3 (Agilent). After RMA normalization, housekeeping genes such as Gapdh showed steady expression (probe AFFX-GapdhMur/M32599_M_at, normalized expression 1.00 0.02). As a general indicator of variability between samples, we calculated Pearson s correlation coefficients. We found that the correlations between duplicates were moderately high: wild-type embryos (0.623), Dll3 embryos (0.584), Notch1 embryos (0.531)."	"GEO"	"partial"		
"GSE12609"	"Transcription profiling of mouse transcription factor Arx null brains"	"Arx is a paired-box homeodomain transcription factor and the vertebrate ortholog to the Drosophila aristaless (al) gene. Mutations in Arx are associated with a variety of human diseases, including X-linked infantile spasm syndrome (OMIM: 308350), X-linked myoclonic epilepsy with mental retardation and spasticity (OMIM: 300432), X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia (OMIM: 300215), X-linked mental retardation 54 (OMIM: 300419), and agenesis of the corpus callosum with abnormal genitalia (OMIM: 300004). Arx-deficient mice exhibit a complex, pleiotrophic phenotype, including decreased proliferation of neuroepithelial cells of the cortex, dysgenesis of the thalamus and olfactory bulbs, and abnormal nonradial migration of GABAergic interneurons. It has been suggested that deficits in interneuron specification, migration, or function lead to loss of inhibitory neurotransmission, which then fails to control excitatory activity and leads to epilepsy or spasticities. Given that Arx mutations are associated with developmental disorders in which epilepsy and spasticity predominate and that Arx-deficient mice exhibit deficits in interneuron migration, understanding the function of Arx in interneuron migration will prove crucial to understanding the pathology underlying interneuronopathies. Yet, downstream transcriptional targets of Arx, to date, remain unidentified. The aim of this project is to identify bona fide transcriptional targets for the Arx, a transcription factor required for normal migration of interneurons from the ganglionic eminences to the cortex, and to investigate the functions of these genes in the Arx-dependent pathway regulating nonradial neuronal migration. We hypothesize that the genes regulated by the Arx transcription factor will play a critical role in the nonradial migration of interneurons and that the results of this study will provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of nonradial neuronal migration, in particular, and possibly the molecular and biochemical pathogenesis underlying epilepsy, mental retardation, infantile spasm syndromes, and other so-called interneuronopathies;; We have recently generated a transgenic mouse with a floxed Arx allele (Arxflox). We have generated conditional knockouts in which Arx is removed specifically from the brain by mating Arxflox mice with transgenic mice expressing Cre behind the neural tube-specific transcriptional regulatory elements of the POU domain, class 3, transcription factor 4 promoter. Preliminary analyses of these mice suggest that conditional knockout mice recapitulate the nonradial migration defects associated with conventional knockout mice. We will compare the gene expression profiles of ganglion eminences (GEs; the anatomical source for nonradially migrating interneurons) from male Arxflox mice that express Pou3f-Cre to those from male mice without Arxflox allele. Animals will be prepared and sacrificed following our institutional protocol. Tissue will be rapidly dissected from E14.5 (the temporal peak of interneuron migration) GEs (MGE and LGE from both left and right hemispheres). Preliminary experiments suggest that the amounts of RNA that can be isolated from a pair of GEs is in the range of 2000-3500 ng, which should be sufficient for microarray analysis following linear amplification of RNA. The GEs from each animal will be combined, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 C until RNA is extracted. Total RNA will be extracted using Trizol followed by RNA purification with the RNeasy cleanup kit. We will be providing total RNA samples from four wildtype and four transgenic animals (true biological replicates) from three separate litters to mitigate any expression differences resulting from mouse to mouse or litter to litter variation."

"GSE7775"	"Transcription profiling of mouse ovaries lacking nobox from newborns"	"Nobox is a homeobox gene expressed in oocytes and critical in oogenesis. Nobox deficiency leads to rapid loss of postnatal oocytes. Early oocyte differentiation is poorly understood. We hypothesized that lack of Nobox perturbs global expression of genes preferentially expressed in oocytes as well as microRNAs. We compared Nobox knockout and wild type ovaries using Affymetrix 430 2.0 microarray platform. We discovered that 28 out of 38 (74%) of the genes down-regulated more than five fold in the absence of Nobox were preferentially expressed in oocytes, while only 5 out of 33 (15%) of genes up-regulated more than five fold in the absence of Nobox, were preferentially expressed in oocytes. Protein binding microarray helped identify nucleotide motifs that NOBOX binds, and that several down-regulated genes contain within putative promoter regions. MicroRNA population in newborn ovaries deficient of Nobox, was largely unaffected. Genes whose proteins are predicted to be secreted, but previously unknown to be significantly expressed in early oogenesis, were down regulated in Nobox knockouts and included astacin-like metalloendopeptidase (Astl), Jagged 1 (Jag1), oocyte secreted protein 1 (Oosp1), fetuin beta (Fetub) and R-spondin 2 (Rspo2). In addition, pluripotency associated genes, Pou5f1 and Sall4 are drastically down-regulated in Nobox deficient ovaries, while testes determining gene Dmrt1 is over-expressed. Our findings indicate that Nobox is likely an activator of oocyte-specific gene expression, and suggest that oocyte plays an important role in suppressing expression of male determining genes such as Dmrt1. Experiment Overall Design: Newborn ovaries were pooled separately from wild type and Nobox -/- animals and total RNA isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, CA). Newborn ovaries were collected within 12 hours of delivery. Animal experimentation was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine. Three independently pooled RNA samples from wild type and Nobox -/- newborn ovaries were used to generate biotinylated cRNA. Biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to GeneChip Mouse Expression Set 430 2.0 (Affymetrix, Inc.). Since three independent experiments were performed from three independent pools of wild type and Nobox -/- RNA, signal intensities for particular genes were averaged between the three chips and ratio of the wild type over knockout signal calculated. Signal less than 100 was considered background. The raw data in the Affymetrix CEL files were normalized by the RMA method (robust multi-array analysis) [15, 16]. Then the null hypothesis was tested that there is no significant changes in gene expression between the treatment pairs. This was done by LIMMA [17] and the pooled local error (LPE) method [18]. The raw pvalues were adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg method for the false discovery rate of 5% [19].

Second, to assess which P450 enzymes are expressed at all at E12.5 during limb development and therefore which metabolic pathways involving this group of enzymes are present at this stage.

When performed comparatively, it may shed light on the mechanisms underlying host susceptibility. In this study, gene expression in the mouse colon was investigated in two cognate lines of mice that differ in their response to Citrobacter rodentium infection; susceptible inbred FVB/N (FVB) and resistant outbred Swiss Webster (SW) mice. Gene expression in the distal colon was investigated prior to infection and at 4 and 9 days post-inoculation using a whole mouse genome Affymetrix array. Computational analysis identified 462 (1%) probe sets differentially expressed by more than 2-fold between uninoculated SW and FVB mice. In response to C. rodentium infection, 5,123 probe sets (11.4%) were significantly modulated in one or both lines of mice. Microarray data were validated by quantitative real time RT-PCR on 35 selected genes (r = 0.87, p < 0.001) and were found to have a 94% concordance. Transcripts represented by 1,547 probe sets (3.4%), were differentially expressed between FVB and SW mice regardless of infection status (host effect). Genes associated with transport were over-represented to a greater extent than immune response-related genes (25% vs. 11% of enrichment, respectively). Electrolyte analysis revealed hypochloremia and hyponatremia in susceptible animals. The results support the hypothesis that mortality in C. rodentium-infected FVB mice is associated with impaired ion transport and development of fatal hypovolemia. These studies contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of C. rodentium and suggest novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of diarrhea associated with bacterial infections of the intestinal tract. Experiment Overall Design: Global gene expression analysis was performed on the distal colon with 2-3 mice per group. Because no difference for any parameters was observed in uninfected mice at 4 or 9 dpi, the animals were pooled into an uninoculated control groups for each line of mouse. The selection of representative samples for microarray analysis was based on known infection status and colonic lesions. The final number of biological replicates for each condition was n = 5 for uninoculated FVB mice ( Fp group), n = 4 for uninoculated SW mice ( Sp group), and n = 3 for infected animals from each line at each time point ( Fi4 , Si4 , Fi9 , and Si9 respectively)."

Food was accessible for 12 hrs only during the active period. Animals were subjected to 14 days of acclimatization during which a nighttime feeding pattern was established. This was done to avoid differential food intake between mice that were subsequently sleep deprived during the lights on period and those allowed to sleep.

When left untreated it has numerous debilitating effects including diabetic retinopathy, which is characterized by the death of retinal neurons as well as a breakdown of the retinal vascularization. This leads to nearly 24,000 cases of blindness each year among diabetic patients. Studies have shown the importance of both nitric oxide and the gene VEGF in retinopathy, however little is known about the condition's progression. This study would determine which genes are affected early in diabetes and more generally, give insite into how neural degeneration occurs in the retina. We aim to show the gene-level changes in the diabetic mouse retina five weeks after induction of diabetes. Our laboratory's primary focus is on NO production through nNOS, iNOS and endothelial (eNOS). We hope to be able to correlate some of the transcript level changes with genes known to be involved in the NO signalling pathways. Previous data by our lab and others have shown that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) are upregulated under diabetic conditions in the retina. Additional work in our lab has shown that the lack of nitric oxide (NO) produced by nNOS may affect neurotransmitter production, particularly with GABA. We have also shown that mice with induced diabetes show neurochemical changes in the retina after only one to three weeks. Thus, we expect to see gene level changes associated with the retina before psysological changes in newly diabetic mice. Adult CD1 mice of random sexes are injected with the drug streptozotocin on three successive days while fasting 8 hours before the injection. This drug selectivley destroys the beta-islet cells of the pancrease. Their blood sugar levels are then tested after a resting period. Mice with glucose levels above 250mg/dL are considered diabetic from the date of the last injection.

We report here the characterization of three novel PPARalpha agonists with therapeutic potential for treating dyslipidemia. These structurally related compounds display potent and selective binding to human PPARalpha and support robust recruitment of coactivator peptides in vitro. These compounds markedly potentiate chimeric transcription systems in cell-based assays and strikingly lower serum triglycerides in vivo. The transcription networks induced by these selective PPARalpha agonists were assessed by transcriptional profiling of mouse liver after acute and chronic treatment. The induction of several known PPARalpha target genes involved with fatty acid metabolism were observed, reflecting the expected pharmacology associated with PPARalpha activation. We also noted the downregulation of a number of genes related to immune cell function, the acute phase response, and glucose metabolism; suggesting that these compounds may have anti-inflammatory action in the mammalian liver. Taken together, these studies articulate the therapeutic promise of a selective PPARalpha agonist.

We found common transcriptional changes, with down-regulation of Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (Igfbp5) representing one of the most robust changes. Igfbp5 down-regulation occurred in granule neurons through a non-cell autonomous mechanism and was concomitant with activation of of the Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway and the type I IGF receptor on Purkinje cells. These data define one common pathogenic response in SCA1 and SCA7 and reveal the importance of intercellular mechanisms in their pathogenesis. Given that SCA1 and SCA7 share a cerebellar degenerative phenotype, we proposed that some shared molecular changes might occur in both diseases, and that common molecular alterations could pinpoint pathways that could be targeted to modulate or monitor the pathogenesis of more than one disease. We focused on transcriptional changes because both ATXN1 and ATXN7 play roles in transcriptional regulation and transcriptional defects can be detected in early-symptomatic stages of both SCA1 and SCA7 mouse models. To test our hypothesis, we examined cerebellar gene expression patterns in SCA1 and SCA7 knock-in (KI) models--Sca1154Q/2Q and Sca7266Q/5Q mice. Experiment Overall Design: Total cerebellar RNA samples were collected from Sca1154Q/2Q knock-in and wild type mice at the early symptomatic disease stage (4 weeks, n=3 knock-in and 3 wild type; 9-12 weeks, n=3 knock-in and 3 wild type). In parallel experiments, total cerebellar RNA samples were collected from Sca7266Q/5Q knock-in and wild type mice also at the early symptomatic disease stage (5 weeks, n=5 knock-in and 5 wild type)."

"GSE10702"	"Transcription profiling of mouse ervical and skin tissues from HPV 16 E6 transgenic animals"	"Background; The in vivo properties of HR-HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins have been previously evaluated through the generation and characterization of HPV transgenic mouse strains. Although K14E6 transgenic mice develop spontaneous tumors of the skin epithelium, no spontaneous reproductive tract malignancies arise, unless the transgenic mice were treated chronically with 17 -estradiol. Taken together, these findings suggest that E6 performs critical functions in normal adult cervix and skin, highlighting the need to define E6-controlled transcriptional programs in these tissues. We evaluated the different expression profile of 14,000 genes in skin or cervix from young K14E6 transgenic mice compared with corresponding tissues from non-transgenic (FVB) mice. Result; Microarray analysis identified a total of 676 and 1154 genes that were significantly up and down-regulated, respectively, in skin from K14E6 transgenic mice. On the other hand, in cervix from K14E6 transgenic mice we found that only 97 and 252 genes were significantly up and down-regulated, respectively. One of the most affected processes in the skin from K14E6 transgenic mice was the cell cycle. We also found that skin from transgenic mice showed down-regulation in pro-apoptotic genes expression, particularly in those related to the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In contrast, we observed up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes. Another pathway that was severely affected in skin was the immune response. In cervix from transgenic mice, we could not find affected any gene related to the cell cycle and apoptosis pathways. Interestingly, we observed alterations in the expression of immune response genes in cervix from K14E6 transgenic mice. Pathways such as angiogenesis, cell junction, cytoskeleton, keratinocyte differentiation and epidermis development, showed different gene expression in skin or cervix from K14E6 transgenic mice. Conclusion; Alterations in gene expression identified in the current study might partially explain why our K14E6 transgenic mice present a more aggressive phenotype in the skin than in the cervix. Expression of the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein alters expression of genes that fell into several functional groups providing insights into pathways by which E6 deregulate cell cycle progression, apoptosis and the host resistance to infection and immune function, providing new opportunities for early diagnostic markers and therapeutic drug targets. Experiment Overall Design: We compared the expression paterns in the skin and cervix of K14E6 transgenic mice against the same tissues from non-transgenic FVB mice. For each tissue, we pooled total RNA from three different 6 week virgin mice. Total RNA from the cervix and lower reproductive tract and dorsal skin were obtained from fresh frozen tissue using Trizol. Total RNA was processed an hybridized onto Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Arrays. For each sample, a technical replica was included."	"GEO"	"partial"

Pathways associated with the response to infection and the development of Lyme arthritis were identified by global gene expression patterns using oligonucleotide microarrays. A robust induction of IFN responsive genes was observed in severely arthritic C3H mice at one week of infection, which was absent from mildly arthritic C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, infected C57BL/6 mice displayed a novel expression profile characterized by genes involved in epidermal differentiation and wound repair, which were decreased in the joints of C3H mice. These expression patterns were associated with disease state rather than inherent differences between C3H and C57BL/6 mice, as C57BL/6-IL10-/- mice infected with B. burgdorferi develop more severe arthritis that C57BL/6 mice and displayed an early gene expression profile similar to C3H mice. Gene expression profiles at two and four weeks post infection revealed a common response of all strains that was likely to be important for the host defense to B. burgdorferi and mediated by NF-kB-dependent signaling. The gene expression profiles identified in this study add to the current understanding of the host response to B. burgdorferi and identify two novel pathways that may be involved in regulating the severity of Lyme arthritis.

Oocyte-derived bone morphogenetic factor 15 (BMP15) and growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) appear to be key regulators of follicular development. The effect of these factors on cumulus cell function before the preovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) was assessed by analysis of the transcriptomes of cumulus cells from wildtype (WT), Bmp15-/-, and Bmp15-/- Gdf9+/- double mutant (DM) mice using microarray analysis. The biological themes associated with the most highly-affected transcripts were identified using bioinformatic approaches, IPA and GenMAPP/MAPPFinder. There were 5,332, 7,640, and 2,651 transcripts identified to be significantly changed in the comparisons of Bmp15-/- vs. WT, DM vs. WT, and DM vs. Bmp15-/- respectively by the criteria of FC (fold change) p <0.01. Among theses changed transcripts, 744 were commonly changed in all three pair-wise comparisons, and hence were considered to be the most highly affected transcripts by mutation of Bmp15 and Gdf9. IPA Analyses revealed that metabolism was the major theme associated with the most highly-changed transcripts: glycolysis and sterol biosynthesis were the two most significantly affected pathways. Most of the transcripts encoding enzymes for sterol biosynthesis were down-regulated in both mutant cumulus cells and in WT cumulus cell after oocytectomy. Similarly, there was a reduction of de novo-synthesized cholesterol in these cumulus cells. This suggests that oocytes regulate cumulus cell metabolism, particularly sterol biosynthesis, by promoting the expression of corresponding transcripts. Furthermore, in WT-mice, Mvk, Pmvk, Fdps, Sqle, Cyp51, Sc4mol, and Ebp, which encode enzymes in the sterol biosynthetic pathway, were found to be expressed robustly in cumulus cells, but expression was barely detectable in oocytes. Levels of de novo-synthesized cholesterol were significantly higher in cumulus enclosed oocytes than denuded oocytes. These results indicate that mouse oocytes are deficient in their ability to synthesize cholesterol and require cumulus cells to provide them with products of the sterol biosynthetic pathway. Oocyte-derived BMP15 and GDF9 may promote this metabolic pathway in cumulus cells as compensation for their own deficiencies. Experiment Overall Design: Three sets of independent cumulus cell samples were collected for each genotype (wild type, Bmp15-/-, and Bmp15-/-Gdf9+/-) of mice, and were used for the array study as shown below.

"GSE9443"	"Transcription profiling of mouse brain Homer1a-expressing cells after sleep deprivation"	"To gain insight into the molecular changes of sleep need, this study addresses gene expression changes in a subpopulation of neurons selectively activated by sleep deprivation. Whole brain expression analyses after 6h sleep deprivation clearly indicate that Homer1a is the best index of sleep need, consistently in all mouse strains analyzed. Transgenic mice expressing a FLAG-tagged poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) under the control of Homer1a promoter were generated. Because PABP binds the poly(A) tails of mRNA, affinity purification of FLAG-tagged PABP proteins from whole brain lysates, is expected to co-precipitate all mRNAs from neurons expressing Homer1a. Three other activity-induced genes (Ptgs2, Jph3, and Nptx2) were identified by this technique to be over-expressed after sleep loss. All four genes play a role in recovery from glutamate-induced neuronal hyperactivity. The consistent activation of Homer1a suggests a role for sleep in intracellular calcium homeostasis for protecting and recovering from the neuronal activation imposed by wakefulness. Experiment Overall Design: Experiments were performed on male mice, 12 weeks of age +/- 1 week. Animals were housed in polycarbonate cages (31x18x18cm) in an experimental room with an ambient temperature varying from 23 to 25 C under a 12:12 hrs light/dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. At light onset mice were either sleep deprived by gentle handling (n=10) or left undisturbed (n=10) for 6 hrs. Animals were then randomly sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Total RNA from the whole brain was isolated for control (n=4) and sleep deprived (n=4) using a commercial RNA extraction kit (RNeasy Lipid Tissue Kit, Quiagen).

The total RNA from the pull-down supernatants were also harvested (n=4). To test for transcriptional changes after sleep deprivation Homer1a-expressing cells, we proceeded in 2 steps: (1) identify probe sets enriched in the pull-down extracts, (2) among those probe sets compare sleep deprivation to control condition in both pull-down (6 vs. 6 chip comparison) and whole-brain (4 vs. 4 chip comparison) extracts. 4728 probe sets were significantly enriched at 5% FDR when pull-downs were compared to both supernatant and whole-brain extracts."

"GSE10360"	"Transcription profiling of mouse vascular segments were isolated from 22 embryos at E13.5 to investigate the role of endothelin in SCG axon pathfinding"	"Sympathetic neurons of SCG (Superior Cervical Ganglia) send axonal projections either along the external carotid arteries to innervate the salivary glands, or along the internal carotid arteries to the lacrimal and pineal glands, the eye, blood vessels and skin of the head, and the mucosa of the oral and nasal cavities. Previous studies using Wnt1Cre and R26R have defined the neural crest and mesodermal origins of vascular smooth muscle in the heart outflow tract and great vessels, although not specifically of the segments that are relevant for the projections of the SCG neurons. The third pharyngeal arch arteries are lined by neural crest-derived smooth muscle, and consequently, their derivatives, including the entirety of the external carotid arteries and only the base of the internal carotid arteries, also have a neural crest origin. In contrast, the dorsal aortae are lined by smooth muscle that is mesodermal in origin, and as a result, the internal carotid arteries from just above their origination from the common carotid arteries have a mesoderm-derived smooth muscle layer. To address the possibility that guidance cues for SCG neurons are selectively expressed by the external carotid vs. the internal carotid arteries, we isolated these segments of the vasculature from mouse embryos at E13.5 and extracted RNA to screen microarrays for differentially expressed genes. Experiment Overall Design: Vascular segments were isolated from 22 embryos at E13.5, pooled and extracted RNA for microarray screen.

"GSE11035"	"Transcription profiling of mouse from wild type, heterozygous and 5HTT knockouts"	"Rationale: While modulation of the serotonin transporter (5HTT) has shown to be a risk factor for pulmonary arterial hypertension for almost 40 years, there is a lack of in vivo data about the broad molecular effects of pulmonary inhibition of 5HTT. Previous studies have suggested effects on inflammation, proliferation, and vasoconstriction. The goal of this study was to determine which of these were supported by alterations in gene expression in serotonin transporter knockout mice. Methods: Eight week old normoxic mice with a 5-HTT knock-out (5HTT-/-) and their heterozygote(5HTT+/-) or wild-type(5HTT+/+) littermates had right ventricular systolic pressure(RVSP) assessed, lungs collected for RNA, pooled, and used in duplicate in Affymetrix array analysis. Representative genes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. Results: RVSP was normal in all groups. Only 124 genes were reliably changed between 5HTT-/- and 5HTT+/+ mice. More than half of these were either involved in inflammatory response or muscle function and organization; in addition, some matrix, heme oxygenase, developmental, and energy metabolism genes showed altered expression. Quantitative RT-PCR for examples from each major group confirmed changes seen by array, with an intermediate level in 5HTT+/- mice. Conclusions: These results for the first time show the in vivo effects of 5HTT knockout in lungs, and show that many of the downstream mechanisms suggested by cell culture and ex vivo experiments are also operational in vivo. This suggests that the effect of 5HTT on pulmonary vascular function arises from its impact on several systems, including vasoreactivity, proliferation, and immune function.

"GSE11777"	"Transcription profiling of mouse fetal liver"	"Iron is essential for all cells but is toxic in excess, so iron absorption and distribution are tightly regulated. Serum iron is bound to transferrin and primarily enters erythroid cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis of the transferrin receptor (Tfr1). Tfr1 is essential for developing erythrocytes and reduced Tfr1 expression is associated with anemia. The transcription factors STAT5A/B are activated by many cytokines, including erythropoietin. Stat5a/b-/- mice are severely anemic and die perinatally, but no link has been made to iron homeostasis. To study the function of STAT5A/B in vivo, we deleted the floxed Stat5a/b locus in hematopoietic cells with a Tie2-Cre transgene. These mice exhibited microcytic, hypochromic anemia, as did lethally irradiated mice transplanted with Stat5a/b-/- fetal liver cells. Flow cytometry and RNA analyses of erythroid cells from mutant mice revealed a 50% reduction in Tfr1 mRNA and protein. We detected STAT5A/B binding sites in the first intron of the Tfr1 gene and found that expression of constitutively active STAT5A in an erythroid cell line increased Tfr1 levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the binding of STAT5A/B to these sites. We conclude that STAT5A/B is an important regulator of erythroid progenitor iron uptake via its control of Tfr1 transcription. Experiment Overall Design: Isolated Ter119-positive fetal liver cells from three to five E14.5 embryos of the same genotype were combined, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) with two additional ethanol precipitations.

The underlying genomic structure of the haplotype can be defined by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) and copy number variations (CNVs). Microarray genotyping platforms are able to interrogate all three genomic polymorphisms simultaneously. Combined with gene expression data, these data allow for the elucidation of sites responsible for the regulation of transcription. Results; Thirty three inbred strains were genotyped on a microarray platform to assess possible contributions of polymorphic regions to gene expression. Over one hundred million statistical correlations were made between probe performance on genotyping and gene expression microarrays. This analysis provided 10,655 trans associations and 31 cis associations. Further investigation of one of the cis associations revealed that a 84kb region of MMU3 acts as a haplotype-specific locus control region for the glutathione-S-transferase mu family in multiple tissues. In the strains that share the minor haplotype, reductions in mRNA levels in members of the Gst mu family are observed. Conclusions; We have identified a haplotype containing a putative locus control region for the Gst mu family gene cassette. In the strains with affected haplotype, Gst mu expression is drastically reduced. The reduction in Gst mu levels has important relevance for pharmacology and toxicology studies. The reduction of Gst mu levels in general, and Gstm5 in particular, has implication in models of dopamine metabolism, Parkinson s disease, and chemical neurotoxicity. Experiment Overall Design: Samples GSM262266-GSM262267, GSM262270-GSM262272 representing liver gene expression Samples from 10 week old male mouse livers were analyzed in a confirmation study of an identified eQTL. Samples came from pools of three animals, and were compared across strains. Experiment Overall Design: The genotyping summary output file and associated .CEL files are linked below as supplementary files. Briefly: Experiment Overall Design: After hybridization and staining the arrays are scanned on an Affymetrix Scanner 3000 7G 4C using four distinct filters, one for each DNA base (A, C, G, T). These scanned images are saved at .dat files. A grid is superimposed on the .dat array image such that each element of the grid brackets a feature. Once the grid has been applied, GCOS computes one intensity value for each cell, and saves these values in a .CEL file. A .CEL file is generated for each possible base (A, C, G, T). Only the .CEL files are read by GTGS. Experiment Overall Design: The .CEL files computed by GCOS are then imported into GTGS and analyzed. The experiments are then clustered together and used to generate a normalized profile of each probe. From the clustered profiles a genotype call is made for every specific probe on an individual chip.

Based on microarray analyses, a subset of spliceosome components and splicing-related factors was coordinately upregulated in the egy mutant. This revealed an extensive network of coregulated components of the spliceosome cycle, compensating albeit inefficiently for the recycling defect. In contrast, another set of genes, many of them eye- and pancreas-specific, was downregulated in the egy mutant embryos. Experiment Overall Design: Zebrafish earl grey (egy) mutant embryos carry an autosomal recessive defect in the p110-orthologous gene which leads to microcephaly, microphthalmia, underdevelopment of the pharyngeal arches, and thymus hypoplasia by day 8 of development. To characterize the defect on the transcriptional level, egy whole embryos (n>100) were collected and morphologically separated into pools of mutant (mut) and wildtype (wt) sibling embryos. Pools of embryos were collected at 2 time points (3 and 4 days post fertilization) with 2 and 3 biological replicates, resp..

"GSE11107"	"Transcription profiling of zebrafish brain and liver in adult female after starvation"	"We used microarray analyses in adult female zebrafish (Danio rerio) to identify metabolic pathways regulated by starvation in two key organs that 1) serve biosynthetic and energy mobilizing functions (liver) and 2) consume energy and direct behavioral responses (brain). Starvation affected the expression of 574 transcripts in the liver, indicating an overall decrease in metabolic activity, reduced lipid metabolism, protein biosynthesis and proteolysis, and cellular respiration, and increased gluconeogenesis. Starvation also regulated expression of many components of the Unfolded Protein Response, the first such report in a species other than yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mice (Mus musculus). The response of the zebrafish hepatic transcriptome to starvation was strikingly similar to that of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), but very different from common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and mouse. The transcriptome of zebrafish whole brain was much less affected than the liver, with only two differentially expressed genes, both down-regulated. Down-regulation of one of these genes, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp9), suggests increased inhibition of apoptosis (neuroprotection) and decreased restructuring of the extracellular matrix in the brain of starved zebrafish. The low level of response in the transcriptome of whole zebrafish brain agrees with observations that the brain is metabolically protected compared to the rest of the body. Experiment Overall Design: Brain treatments: Starved (21 days) and Control (Fed). Four microarrays per treatment. Experiment Overall Design: Liver treatments: Starved (21 days) and Control (Fed). Five microarrays per treatment. Experiment Overall Design: Data for brain and liver were normalized and analyzed separately because variances of expression differed considerably between the tissues."

"GSE5048"	"Transcription profiling of zebrafish embryonic retinal pigment epithelium in vivo"	"Eye development and photoreceptor maintenance requires the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a thin layer of cells that underlies the neural retina. Despite its importance, RPE development has not been studied by a genomic approach. A microarray expression profiling methodology was established in this study for studying RPE development. The intact retina with RPE attached was dissected from developing embryos, and differentially expressed genes in RPE were inferred by comparing the dissected tissues with retinas without RPE using microarray and statistical analyses. We found 8810 probesets to be significantly expressed in RPE at 52 hours post-fertilization (hpf), of which 1443 might have biologically meaningful expression levels. Further, 78 and 988 probesets were found to be significantly over- or under-expressed in RPE respectively compared to retina. Also, 79.2% (38/48) of the known over-expressed probesets have been independently validated as RPE-related transcripts. The results strongly suggest that this methodology can obtain in vivo RPE specific gene expression from the zebrafish embryos and identify novel RPE markers. Experiment Overall Design: The gene expression levels of three independent replicates of retina with RPE attached consisting of ten samples each at 52hpf (WRR52) were compared with three independent pure retinal samples consisting of ten retinas each at 52hpf (WR52). The yield-adjusted WR52 expression values were assumed to be equivalent to the retinal contribution in WRR52 samples and deducted from WRR52 expression values to obtain estimations of RPE gene expression at 52hpf (RPE52). Differential gene expressions between RPE and retina were inferred by comparing the RPE52 estimates and WR52 expression values."

A point mutation in a brahma-related gene 1 (brg1) is responsible for this phenotype. In this microarray study, a three-factor factorial design was utilized to investigate the effects of 1) mutation, 2) change in time (36 vs. 52hpf), and 3) change in tissue (retina vs. whole embryos), and their interactions on gene expression. Significant probesets were inferred by using both specific contrasts of the fitted Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) models and a corresponding 2-fold expression cutoff. The probesets were grouped into three broad categories: 1) Brg1-regulated retinal differentiation genes (731 probsets), 2) Retinal specific genes but independent of Brg1 regulation (3038 probesets) and 3) Genes regulated by Brg1 but outside the retina (107 probesets). Four gene groups/pathways including neurite outgrowth regulators, Delta-Notch signalling molecules, Irx family members and specific cell cycle regulators were identified in the first group, and their relevance for retinal differentiation functionally validated. This study demonstrates that an approach such as ours can identify relevant genes and pathways involved in retinal development as well as the development of other tissues at the same time. Experiment Overall Design: The gene expression levels of three independent replicates of retina consisting of ten samples each at 36 and 52hpf retinas from WT (WR36 & WR52) and yng (YR36 & YR52) larvae, and stage-matched whole embryos: WT at 36hpf (WA36), WT at 52hpf (WA52), yng at 36hpf (YA36), and yng at 52hpf (YA52) were measured by Affymetrix Zebrafish Whole Genome Arrays. We analyzed the effects of these factors on gene expression levels: 1) mutation (M), 2) tissue (R), and 3) time (T). Each of these factors have two levels: mutant and WT (M); retinas and whole body (R); and 36 and 52 hpf (T). As a result, there are totally eight conditions for all the comparisons and the design is called a 2x2x2 factorial design. The aim of a factorial analysis is to delineate the effects of each factor and their combinations (interaction) on gene expression. The overall analysis strategy is to first fit a full Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model with all possible main effects (T, M, R) and their interactions (T*M, M*R, R*M, T*M*R) to the gene expression data for each probeset. The estimates of the model are obtained through a maximum likelihood estimation method. Then a backward elimination strategy is used to remove insignificant main effects and interactions to get the most parsimonious models. Finally, a group of contrasts and their corresponding fold changes are used to infer whether that probeset is significantly associated with a particular biological process."	"GEO"	"partial"

However, knowledge about the signaling molecules in the local microenvironment of a retinal injury and the transcriptional events they activate during neuronal death and regeneration is still lacking. To identify genes involved in photoreceptor regeneration, we combined light-induced photoreceptor lesions, laser-capture microdissection (LCM) of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and analysis of gene expression to characterize transcriptional changes for cells in the ONL as photoreceptors die and are regenerated. Using this approach, we were able to characterize aspects of the molecular signature of injured and dying photoreceptors, cone photoreceptor progenitors and microglia within the ONL. We validated changes in gene expression and characterized the cellular expression for three novel, extracellular signaling molecules that we hypothesize are involved in regulating regenerative events in the retina. Experiment Overall Design: As a means to identify genes necessary for photoreceptor regeneration, we evaluated transcriptional changes for cells in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) as photoreceptors die and are regenerated.

The extreme rates of evolution seen in Acps may be driven by sperm competition and sexual conflict, processes which may ultimately drive complex interactions between female- and male-derived molecules and sperm. However, little is known of how gene expression in female reproductive tissues changes in response to the presence of male molecules and sperm. To characterize this response, we conducted parallel genomic and proteomic analyses of gene expression in the reproductive tract of 3-day-old unmated and mated female Drosophila melanogaster. Using DNA microarrays, we identified 539 transcripts that are differentially expressed in unmated vs. mated females and revealed a striking peak in differential expression at 6 hrs postmating and a marked shift from primarily down-regulated to primarily up-regulated transcripts within 3 hrs after mating. Combining two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analyses, we identified 84 differentially expressed proteins at 3 hrs postmating, including proteins which appeared to undergo post-translational modification. Together, our observations define transcriptional and translational response to mating within the female reproductive tract and suggest a bimodal model of postmating gene expression initially correlated with mating and the final stages of female reproductive tract maturation and later with the declining presence of male reproductive molecules and with sperm maintenance and utilization. Experiment Overall Design: Three-day-old mated and unmated females were dissected to remove the lower reproductive tract (upper uterus, sperm-storage organs, and accessory glands).

The midgut is the critical site affected by dietary lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). We observed marked cellular structural and gene expression changes in Drosophila melanogaster third-instar larval midguts from insects WGA-fed or starved. Dietary WGA caused shortening, branching, swelling, distortion and in some cases disintegration of the midgut microvilli (Mv). Starvation was accompanied by shortening of the Mv. Microarray analyses revealed that dietary WGA evolved differential expression of 62 transcripts; seven of which were also differentially expressed in starved insects. The differentially regulated gene cluster in WGA-fed larvae were associated with (i) cytoskeletal organization, (ii) immune responses, (iii) detoxification reactions, and (iv) energy metabolism. Four putative transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) were associated with the differentially-expressed genes. At least one of these putative TFBMs exhibited substantial similarity to MyoD, a TFBM associated with cellular structures in mammals.

Our analysis of a large number of published gene expression patterns in the follicle cells suggests that they follow a simple combinatorial code based on six spatial building blocks and the operations of union, difference, intersection, and addition. The building blocks are related to the distribution of inductive signals, provided by the highly conserved epidermal growth factor receptor and Decapentaplegic; (DPP) pathways. We demonstrate the validity of the code by testing it against a set of patterns obtained in a large-scale transcriptional profiling experiment. Using the proposed code, we distinguish 36 distinct patterns for 81 genes expressed in the follicular epithelium and characterize their joint dynamics over four stages of oogenesis. The proposed combinatorial; framework allows systematic analysis of the diversity and dynamics of two-dimensional transcriptional patterns and guides future studies of gene; regulation. Experiment Overall Design: RNA was isolated from hand dissected, stage 9-10 egg chambers. Five genetic backgrounds were profiled including: wild type, EGFR gain of function, EGFR loss of function, BMP gain of function, and BMP loss of function. Three biological replicates were hybridized for each pathway perturbation. The samples were split across two rounds of hybridization. Each round of hybridizations included three biological replicates for wild type: Experiment Overall Design: The first round included EGFR gof, EGFR lof, BMP gof, and wild type controls A1-A3 (GSM313514-16). For these 12 arrays the extraction, labeling, and hybridization steps were done in parallel. Experiment Overall Design: The second round included the BMP lof and wild type controls B1-B3 (GSM313517-19).

"#GSE11046"	"Transcription profiling of Drosophila melanogaster larval midguts to investigate the influence of Bwoman-Birk Inhibitor"	"Bowman-Birk Inhibitor (BBI) has both insecticidal and anti-cancerous properties. It has been hypothesized that dietary BBI slows insect growth by inhibiting the catalytic activity of digestive enzymes trypsins and chyomotrypsins, resulting in the midgut having reduced access to amino acids needed for growth. In mammals, BBI was hypothesized to influence cellular energy metabolism. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that dietary BBI also impacts energy-associated pathways in the midgut of Drosophila melanogaster. We investigated the impact of dietary BBI on the following parameters in the midguts of third-instar Drosophila larvae: (i) cellular metabolites, (ii) global transcriptome response, (iii) putative transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) associated with the differentially expressed transcripts, and (iv) epithelial cellular structure. Dietary BBI caused: (i) a reduction of cellular DHAP, glucose, and succinate; and, (ii) increased Fructuse-6-phosphate; (ii) differential expression of genes associated with the glucose and fatty acid utilization; and, (iii) a shortening of midgut epithelial microvilli, a phenomenon previously associated with glucose starvation. Additionally, fifty seven percent of the putative TFBSs associated with the differentially expressed transcripts have previously been associated with glucose and insulin activities in mammalian studies. Collectively these results support the hypothesis that dietary BBI influences energy utilization in the Drosophila midgut. Experiment Overall Design: Two treatments (control vs BBI-fed), and three replicates were conducted. There were total six samples. There was no dye-swap."

"GSE3955"	"Transcription profiling of Drosophila melanogaster at multiple developmental stages to examine morphogenesis of epithelial tissue"	"Morphogenesis of epithelial tissues relies on the precise developmental control of cell polarity and architecture. In the early Drosophila embryo, the primary epithelium forms during cellularisation, following a tightly controlled genetic programme where specific sets of genes are up-regulated. Some of them, for instance, control membrane invagination between the nuclei anchored at the apical surface of the syncytium. We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying cellularisation and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. Experiment Overall Design: Drosophila embryos were selected at successive stages of early development for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We sought to obtain homogeneous populations of embryos at each developmental stage in order to increase the temporal resolution of expression profiles. To that end, we hand-selected embryos according to morphological criteria at five time-points: before pole cell formation, i.e. before zygotic transcription (T0), during the slow phase (T1) and the fast phase (T2) of cellularisation and at the beginning (T3) and the end (T4) of gastrulation."

Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in laser capture microdissected components of the developing kidney. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone.

"GSE6678"	"Transcription profiling of palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 knockout mice"	"Infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (aka infantile Batten disease) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder of early childhood characterized by cortical atrophy, blindness and seizures, leading to premature death in the first decade. The disorder is caused by deficiency in a soluble lysosomal enzyme, palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1). PPT1 knockout mice faithfully reproduce the features of the human disease, with motor deterioration, blindness, seizures, and death before 10 months of age. The progression of events leading from enzyme deficiency to organ failure is poorly defined. The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses are of particular interest because of the similarities between the accumulated material and lipofuscin that is associated with normal aging. We will determine changes in gene expression that occur during the course of neurodegeneration in PPT1 knockout as compared to control mice. Gene expression profiling of brain tissue from PPT1 knockout mice as compared to normal controls will provide insights into the mechanism of neurodegeneration. Comparison of this profile with gene expression profiles associated with normal aging may provide insights into the contribution of lipofuscin to aging and neurodegeneration. PPT1 knockout mice on a C57BL/6 background will be sacrificed under CO2 and whole brains removed and frozen under liquid nitrogen. Three mice will be used for each time point. Data points will be collected at 3 months, 5 months and 8 months of age. Normal age- and sex-matched C57BL/6 mice will be used as controls."	"GEO"	"partial"		
"GSE11450"	"Transcription profiling of human mature oocytes and embryonic stem cells reveals overexpression of the proteasome pathway"	"The first week of human pre-embryo development is characterized by the induction of totipotency and then pluripotency. The understanding of this delicate process will have far reaching implication for in vitro fertilization and regenerative medicine. Human mature MII oocytes and embryonic stem (ES) cells are both able to achieve the feat of cell reprogramming towards pluripotency, either by somatic cell nuclear transfer or by cell fusion, respectively. Comparison of the transcriptome of these two cell types may highlight genes that are involved in pluripotency initiation. Therefore, based on a microarray compendium of 205 samples, produced in our laboratory or from public databases, we compared the gene expression profile of mature MII oocytes and human ES cells (hESC) to that of somatic tissues. We identified a common oocyte/hESC gene expression profile, which included a strong cell cycle signature, a large chromatin remodelling network (TOP2A, DNMT3B, JARID2, SMARCA5, CBX1, CBX5) and 18 different zinc finger transcription factors, including ZNF84. Strikingly, a large set of genes was found to code for proteins involved in the ubiquitination and proteasome pathway. Upon hESC differentiation into embryoid bodies, the transcription of this pathway declines. In vitro, we observed a selective sensitivity of hESC to the inhibition of the activity of the proteasome, resulting in loss of pluripotency and cell growth at doses without any detectable effects on differentiated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the proteasome pathway may play a role in initiating and maintaining pluripotency during early development and in hESC. Experiment Overall Design: We included in this study 9 samples obtained in our laboratory. These samples were hybridized on U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix). All samples were normalized using the MAS5 (GCOS 1.2) algorithm, using the default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method, with a trimmed mean target intensity value (TGT) of each array arbitrarily set to 100.

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the lithium s therapeutic action still remains elusive. The goal of the proposed study is to identify genes involved in the lithium-responsive neurological pathway using the fruit fly as a model organism. Based on the fact that the fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms are well conserved between the fruit fly and vertebrates, the outcomes of this project are expected to lead to the recognition of uncharacterized players or processes responsible for the lithium action in the vertebrates, which would open up the future possibility to develop novel and improved therapies for BPD. The proposed gene-profiling experiment is designed to identify candidate genes and genetic pathways involved in the lithium-responsive biological process. Specific aims of this project are; 1) identify genes whose expression levels are significantly different between the wild type and Shu, 2) identify genes whose expression levels are enhanced or suppressed after lithium treatment, and 3) identify genes whose expression is differentially regulated in the wild type and Shu after lithium treatment. We expect that the genes identified through the proposed microarray analysis will provide important clues for elucidating the molecular and cellular processes responsible for the lithium action. A Drosophila mutant Shudderer (Shu) exhibits various neurological phenotypes, including hyperactivity, uncoordinated movements, and sporadically occurring jerks. Interestingly, many of these phenotypes are greatly suppressed by lithium with the internal concentrations used for treatment of human BPD patients. In addition, Shu mutant is more resistant to the toxic effects of lithium than the wild type strain. These data have led us to the hypothesis that the biological process responsive to lithium is affected in the Shu mutant. We expect that we will be able to identify genes and genetic pathways involved in the lithium-responsive process by comparing the gene expression profiles between the wild type and the Shu mutant with or without lithium treatment. Newly eclosed Canton-S (wild type) and Shu mutant females will be placed in vials containing fly food with or without 50mM LiCl. They will be cultured at 25oC with 65% humidity for 5 days.

We addressed this question in Drosophila melanogaster where the effects of single transposable elements on complex traits can be assessed in genetically identical individuals reared in controlled environments. Here we demonstrate that single P-element insertions in the intergenic region between the Gustatory receptor 5a (Gr5a) and Trapped in endoderm 1 (Tre1), which encodes an orphan receptor, exert complex pleiotropic effects on fitness traits, including selective nutrient intake, resistance to starvation and heat stress, and life span. Mutations in this region interact epistatically with downstream components of the insulin signaling pathway. Transposon-induced sex-specific and sex-antagonistic effects further accentuate the complex influences intergenic transposable elements can contribute to complex phenotypes.

"GSE11231"	"Transcription profiling of Drosphilia embryos shows the zinc finger protein Zelda plays a key role in the maternal to zygotic transition"	"In all animals, the initial events of embryogenesis are controlled by maternal gene products that are deposited into the developing oocyte. At some point after fertilization, control of embryogenesis is transferred to the zygotic genome in a process called the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT). During this time maternal RNAs are degraded and zygotic RNAs are transcribed1. A long standing question has been, what factors regulate these events? The recent findings that microRNAs and Smaugs mediate maternal transcript degradation brought new life to this old problem2,3, however, the transcription factors that activate zygotic gene expression remained elusive. A clue came from the finding that many early zygotic genes in Drosophila share a cis-regulatory heptamer motif, CAGGTAG and related sequences, collectively referred to as TAG-team sites4,5. We asked whether there was a dedicated transcription factor that interacts with these sites to activate early genes. Here we report the discovery of a zinc-finger protein, Zelda (Zld) that binds specifically to TAG-team sites, and is capable of activating transcription in transient transfection assays. Mutant embryos lacking zld are defective in the cellularization process, and fail to activate the transcription of many early zygotic genes involved in cellularization, sex determination, and dorsoventral patterning. Global expression profiling confirmed that Zld plays a key role in the activation of the early zygotic genome, and suggests that Zld may also play a role in maternal RNA degradation during the MZT since many RNAs are up-regulated in the absence of Zld. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA samples were extracted from three replicate collections of 1-2 hr yw and M- zld embryos by TRIzol (invitrogen).

New perspectives on the global gene changes that are associated with brain aging emerged, revealing two overarching concepts. First, different regions of the forebrain exhibited substantially different gene profile changes with age. For example, comparing equally powered groups, 5,029 probe sets were significantly altered with age (20-59 vs. 60-99) in the superior frontal gyrus, compared with 1,110 in the entorhinal cortex. Prominent change occurred in the 6th-7th decades across cortical regions, suggesting that this period is a critical transition point in brain aging, particularly in males. Second, clear gender differences in brain aging were evident across the lifespan, suggesting that the brain undergoes sexually dimorphic changes in gene expression not only in development but also in later life. Globally across all brain regions, males showed more gene change than females. Further, Gene Ontology analysis revealed that different categories of genes were predominantly affected in males vs. females. Notably, the male brain was characterized by global decreased catabolic and anabolic capacity with aging, with downregulated genes heavily enriched in energy production and protein synthesis/transport categories. Increased immune activation was a prominent feature of aging in both sexes, with more widespread activation in the female brain. These data open new opportunities to explore age-dependent changes in gene expression that set the balance between neurodegeneration and compensatory mechanisms in the brain, and suggest that this balance is set differently in males and females, an intriguing and novel idea. HgU133plus2.0 microarray chips were used to profile gene expression in 4 brain regions of cognitively intact humans, across the adult lifespan (ages 20-99).

After 4.5 days of repeated combined acoustic and restraint stress as a murine model of chronic psychological stress severe metabolic dysregulations became detectable in female BALB/c mice. Stress-induced alterations of metabolic processes that were found in a hepatic mRNA expression profiling were verified by in vivo analyses. Repeatedly stressed mice developed a hypermetabolic syndrome with severe loss of lean body mass, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, increased amino acid turn-over, and acidosis. This was associated with hypercortisolism, hyperleptinemia, insulin resistance, and hypothyroidism. In contrast, after a single acute stress exposure changes in expression of metabolic genes were much less pronounced and predominantly confined to gluconeogenesis, probably indicating that metabolic disturbances might be initiated already early but will only manifest in repeatedly stressed mice .Thus, in our murine model, repeated stress caused severe metabolic dysregulations leading to a drastic reduction of the individual s energy reserves. Under such circumstances stress may further reduce the ability to cope with new stressors such as infection or cancer.

"GSE4866"	"Transcription profiling of mouse carrying a mutator DNA polymerase gamma to investigate age related hearing loss"	"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations may contribute to aging and age-related disorders. Previously, we created mice expressing a proofreading-deficient version of the mtDNA polymerase gamma (Polg) which accumulate age-related mtDNA mutations and display premature aging. Here we performed microarray gene expression profiling to identify mtDNA mutation-responsive genes in the cochlea of aged mitochondrial mutator mice. Age-related accumulation of mtDNA mutations was associated with transcriptional alternations consistent with reduced inner ear function, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and reduced cell structural modulation. Hearing assessment and histopathological results confirmed that aged PolgD257A/D257A (D257A) mice exhibited moderate hearing loss and severe cochlear degenerations. Age-related accumulation of mtDNA mutations also resulted in alternations in gene expression consistent with induction of apoptosis, proteolysis, stress response, and reduced DNA repair. TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) assay confirmed that the cochleae from aged D257A mice showed significantly more TUNEL positive cells compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The levels of cleaved caspase-3 were also found to increase in the cochleae of aged D257A mice. These observations provide evidence that age-related accumulation of mtDNA mutations is associated with apoptotic cell death in aged cochlea. Our results provide the first global view of molecular events associated with mtDNA mutations in postmitotic tissue, and suggest that apoptosis is the major mechanism of mtDNA mediated cell death in the development of age-related hearing disorder. Experiment Overall Design: To determine the effects of age-related accumulation of mtDNA mutations, each WT sample (n = 5) was compared to each D257A sample (n = 5), generating a total of twenty-five pairwise comparisons. Genes with significantly altered expression levels were sorted into gene ontology biological process categories. Experiment Overall Design: Gene expression change was called statistically significant when at least one gene was called present in a group, the P value was < 0.0500, FC was > 1.1, and FDR was > 30.00 for identification of mtDNA mutations-induced genes.

"GSE7694"	"Transcription profiling of mouse cannabinoid receptor double knockout (Cnr1 -/- /Cnr2 -/-) in CHS model"	"We evaluated cutaneous contact hypersensitivity (CHS) in Cnr1-/-/Cnr2-/- animals using the obligate contact allergen 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), which generates a specific cutaneous T-cell mediated allergic response upon repeated allergen contact. Allergic contact dermatitis affects about 5% of men and 11% of women in industrialized countries and is one of the leading causes for occupational diseases. In an animal model for cutaneous contact hypersensitivity we show that mice lacking both known cannabinoid receptors display exacerbated allergic inflammation. In contrast, fatty acid amide hydrolase deficient mice, which have increased levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide, displayed reduced allergic responses in the skin. Cannabinoid receptor antagonists exacerbated whereas receptor agonists attenuated allergic inflammation. These results demonstrate a protective role of the endocannabinoid system in contact allergy in the skin, and suggest a novel target for therapeutic intervention. Experiment Overall Design: Three wildtype mice (Wt) and three Cnr1-/-/Cnr2-/- (Ko) mice were used. Contact hypersensitivity was determined always at the right ears, which therefore were treated with DNFB (Tr). Left ears of mice were kept untreated and served as control ears (C).

To dissect the major determinants of LVM, we combined expression quantitative trait locus1 and quantitative trait transcript (QTT) analyses of the cardiac transcriptome in the rat. Using these methods and in vitro functional assays, we identified osteoglycin (Ogn) as a major candidate regulator of rat LVM, with increased Ogn protein expression associated with elevated LVM. We also applied genome-wide QTT analysis to the human heart and observed that, out of 22,000 transcripts, OGN transcript abundance had the highest correlation with LVM. We further confirmed a role for Ogn in the in vivo regulation of LVM in Ogn knockout mice. Taken together, these data implicate Ogn as a key regulator of LVM in rats, mice and humans, and suggest that Ogn modifies the hypertrophic response to extrinsic factors such as hypertension and aortic stenosis.

In our study we were searching for the genetic background of the polygenic neural tube defect, which is the second most common birth defect in the world (1 in 1000 live births). Our data revealed novel candidate genes, like SLAP, LST1 and BENE, which can play an important role in the pathogenesis of neural tube defects. We created a data warehouse from the results, suitable for further analysis. This study also demonstrates that a routinely collected amount of amniotic fluid (as small as 6 mL) is enough to successfully hybridize isolated RNA to expression arrays, making the ability to use the technique from normally collected amniotic fluid samples.

One of the leading risk factors for development of atherosclerosis is familial hypercholesterolemia. Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder, which is caused by mutations mainly located in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. It is characterized by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the presence of tendon xanthomas, and premature cardiovascular disease. Aim of this study was to find atherosclerotic markers in white blood cells of patients compared to healthy controls. None of these patients exhibited symptoms of atherosclerosis by standard diagnostic methods; however, transcriptome analysis of blood RNA indicated changes in ubiquitin proteolysis and cell adhesion system as expected in initiation steps of atherosclerosis. Experiment Overall Design: Five patients diagnosed with Familial hypercholesterolemia and five age, sex, BMI and smoking status matched controls contributed blood from which total RNA from white blood cells was isolated.

"GSE6044"	"Transcription profiling of human lung cancers for molecular discrimination and characterization"	"Lung cancers are a heterogeneous group of diseases with respect to biology and clinical behavior. So far, diagnosis and classification are based on histological morphology and immunohistological methods for discrimination between two main histologic groups: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer which account for 20% and 80% of lung carcinomas, respectively. While SCLCs express properties of neuroendocrine cells, NSCLCs, which are divided into the three major subtypes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and dedifferentiated large cell carcinoma, show different characteristics such as the expression of certain keratins or production of mucin and lack neuroedocrine differentiation. The molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer involves the accumulation of genetic und epigenetic alterations including the activation of proto-oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes which are different for lung cancer subgroups. The development of microarray technologies opened up the possibility to quantify the expression of a large number of genes simultaneously in a given sample. There are several recent reports on expression profiling on lung cancers but the analysis interpretation of the results might be difficult because of the heterogeneity of cellular components. A contamination of the tumor sample with normal epithelia, blood vessels, stromal cells, leucocytes and tumor necrosis may confound the true expression profile of the tumor. The use of laser capture microdissection (LCM) greatly improves the sample preparation for microarray expression analysis. Consequently, we used advanced technology including LCM and microarray analysis. In detail, we examined gene expression profiles of tumor cells from 29 previously untreated patients with lung cancer (10 adenocarcinomas (AC), 10 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 9 small cell lung cancer (SCLC)) in comparison to normal lung tissue (LT) of 5 control patients without tumor. Bronchoscopical biopsies from the primary lung tumor were taken before treatment. Biopsies were cut into 8 m sections and from each section cancer cells were isolated using laser capture microdissection in order to obtain pure samples of tumor cells. Total RNA was extracted, reversely transcribed, in-vitro transcribed, labelled and hybridized to the array. For expression analysis, microarrays covering 8793 defined genes (Human HG Focus Array, Affymetrix) were used. Following quality control, array data were normalized and analysed for significant differences using variance stabilizing transformation (VSN) and significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), respectively. Based on differentially expressed genes cancer samples could be clearly separated from non cancer samples using hierarchical clustering. Comparing AC, SCC and SCLC with normal lung tissue, we found 205, 335 and 404 genes, respectively, that were at least 2-fold differentially expressed with an estimated false discovery rate < 2.6%. Each histological subtype showed a distinct expression profile. Further, using a genetic programming approach we constructed a classificator to discriminate AC, SCC, NT and SCLC. To this end, the 50 genes with the greatest signal-to-noise ratio were selected to train the classificator. By leave-one-out cross validation all 34 samples were correctly classified in this training set. In order to validate the 50-gene-classificator on a test set, further 13 microdissected lung cancer samples were used and correctly classified in concordance to pathologic finding. In conclusion, the different lung cancer subtypes have distinct molecular phenotypes which reflect biological characteristics of the tumor cells and which might be the basis for development of targeted therapy. Moreover, gene expression profiling and genetic programming is a suitable tool for classification and discrimination of different histological subtypes in lung cancer in comparison to normal lung tissue.

"GSE8514"	"Transcription profiling of human normal adrenal gland and aldosterone-producing adenoma"	"The source of aldosterone in 30 to 40 % of patients with primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) is unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA). The mechanisms causing elevated aldosterone production in APA are unknown. Herein, we examined expression of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) in APA and demonstrate that compared to normal adrenals there is a general elevation of certain GPCR in many APA and/or ectopic expression of GPCR in others. RNA samples from normal adrenals (n = 5), APAs (n = 10), and cortisol-producing adenomas (CPAs) (n=13) were used on 15 genomic expression arrays, each of which included 223 GPCR transcripts presented in at least one out of 15 of the independent microarrays. The array results were confirmed using real-time RT-PCR (qPCR). Four GPCR transcripts exhibited a statistically significant increase that was greater than 3-fold compared to normal adrenals, suggesting a general increase in expression compared to normal adrenal glands. Four GPCR transcripts exhibited a greater than 15-fold increase of expression in one or more of the APA samples compared to normal adrenals. qPCR analysis confirmed array data and found the receptors with the highest fold increase in APA expression to be luteinizing hormone receptor (LH-R), serotonin receptor 4 (HTR4), gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), glutamate receptor metabotropic 3 (GRM3), endothelin receptor type B-like protein (GPR37), and ACTH receptor (MC2R). There are also sporadic increased expressions of these genes in the CPAs. Together, these findings suggest a potential role of altered GPCR expression in many cases of PA and provide candidate GPCR for further study."	"GEO"	"partial"		
"GSE9574"	"Transcription profiling of normal breast epithelium of breast cancer patients reveals gene expression abnormalities"	"Normal-appearing epithelium of cancer patients can harbor occult genetic abnormalities. Data comprehensively comparing gene expression between histologically normal breast epithelium of breast cancer patients and cancer-free controls are limited. The present study compares global gene expression between these groups. We performed microarrays using RNA from microdissected histologically normal terminal ductal-lobular units (TDLU) from 2 groups: (i) cancer normal (CN) (TDLUs adjacent to untreated ER1 breast cancers (n = 14)) and (ii) reduction mammoplasty (RM) (TDLUs of age-matched women without breast disease (n = 15)). Cyber-T identi?ed differentially expressed genes. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and comparison to independent microarray data including 6 carcinomas in situ (CIS), validated the results. Gene ontology (GO), UniProt and published literature evaluated gene function. About 127 probesets, corresponding to 105 genes, were differentially expressed between CN and RM (p < 0.0009, corresponding to FDR <0.10). 104/127 (82%) probesets were also differentially expressed between CIS and RM, nearly always (102/104 (98%)) in the same direction as in CN vs. RM. Two-thirds of the 105 genes were implicated previously in carcinogenesis. Overrepresented functional groups included transcription, G-protein coupled and chemokine receptor activity, the MAPK cascade and immediate early genes. Most genes in these categories were under-expressed in CN vs. RM. We conclude that global gene expression abnormalities exist in normal epithelium of breast cancer patients and are also present in early cancers. Thus, cancer-related pathways may be perturbed in normal epithelium. These abnormalities could be markers of disease risk, occult disease, or the tissue s response to an existing tumor.

"GSE7224"	"Transcription profiling of human tonsil and oral epithelia"	"To study characteristics of the orapharyngeal epithelia which may influence susceptibility or resistance to HIV, we performed microarray analysis of the tonsil and gingival epithelium.Tonsil epithelium has been implicated in HIV pathogenesis, but its role in oral transmission remains controversial. We performed microarray analysis of Laser Capture Microdissected tonsil and gingival epithelium. Our data revealed that genes related to immune functions such as antibody production and antigen processing were increasingly expressed in tonsil compared to the epithelium of another oro-pharyngeal site, gingival epithelium. Importantly, tonsil epithelium highly expressed genes associated with HIV entrapment and/or transmission, including the HIV co-receptor CXCR4 and the potential HIV binding molecules, FcR III, complement receptor 2, and various complement components. This increased expression of molecules involved in viral recognition, binding and entry may favor virus-epithelium interaction in an environment with reduced innate anti-viral mechanisms. Specifically, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, an innate molecule with anti-HIV activity, was minimal in the tonsil epithelium, in contrast to oral mucosa. Collectively, our data suggest that increased expression of molecules associated with HIV binding and entry coupled with decreased innate anti-viral factors may render the tonsil a potential site for oral transmission. Experiment Overall Design: To study characteristics of the orapharyngeal epithelia which may influence susceptibility or resistance to HIV, we performed microarray analysis of the tonsil and gingival epithelium. Experiment Overall Design: Human palatine tonsils were obtained from routine therapeutic tonsillectomies (sleep apnea and non-tonsillitis) performed on otherwise healthy adults at the George Washington University Hospital with informed consent (IRB #099920). Gingival tissues were collected from healthy sites with probing depths < 3mm, with no clinical evidence of inflammation during routine therapeutic periodontal surgery at the University of Maryland, Department of Periodontics, with informed consent (IRB#1201211).

To characterize biological processes involved in PTC invasion, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of microscopically dissected intratumoral samples from central and invasive regions of seven widely invasive PTCs and normal thyroid tissue by oligonucleotide microarray and performed confirmatory expression and functional studies. In comparison to the central regions of primary PTCs, the invasive fronts overexpressed TGFbeta, NFkappab and integrin pathway members, and regulators of small G-proteins and CDC42. Moreover, reduced levels of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion and communication were identified, consistent with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To confirm that aggressive PTCs were characterized by EMT, 35 additional PTCs were examined for expression of vimentin, a hallmark of EMT. Overexpression of vimentin was associated with PTC invasion and nodal metastasis. Functional, in vitro studies demonstrated that vimentin was required for the development and maintenance of both a mesenchymal morphology and invasiveness in thyroid cancer cells. We conclude that EMT is a common mechanism of PTC invasion and that vimentin regulates thyroid cancer EMT in vitro. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was obtained from all 7 central and invasion regions, as well as from 4 of 7 normal tissues.

"GSE2164"	"Transcription profiling of post-mortem human brain to investigate gender specific gene expression"	"Gender differences in brain development and in the prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression have been reported. Gender differences in human brain might be related to patterns of gene expression. Microarray technology is one useful method for investigation of gene expression in brain. We investigated gene expression, cell types, and regional expression patterns of differentially expressed sex chromosome genes in brain. We profiled gene expression in male and female dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum using the Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray platform. Differentially expressed genes between males and females on the Y chromosome (DBY, SMCY, UTY, RPS4Y, and USP9Y) and X chromosome (XIST) were confirmed using real-time PCR measurements. In situ hybridization confirmed the differential expression of gender-specific genes and neuronal expression of XIST, RPS4Y, SMCY, and UTY in three brain regions examined. The XIST gene, which silences gene expression on regions of the X chromosome, is expressed in a subset of neurons. Since a subset of neurons express gender-specific genes, neural subpopulations may exhibit a subtle sexual dimorphism at the level of differences in gene regulation and function. The distinctive pattern of neuronal expression of XIST, RPS4Y, SMCY, and UTY and other sex chromosome genes in neuronal subpopulations may possibly contribute to gender differences in prevalence noted for some neuropsychiatric disorders. Studies of the protein expression of these sex-chromosome-linked genes in brain tissue are required to address the functional consequences of the observed gene expression differences. Experimental design: Two groups of male control subjects and female control subjects were selected that had no history of psychiatric disorder. Each subject was analyzed by microarray in 3 brain regions: AnCg (anterior cingulate cortex), DLPFC (dorsalateral prefrontal cortex), and CB (cerebellum). Total RNA aliquots for some subjects were analyzed at either 1 site, 2 sites, or 3 sites (UM , University of Michigan); UCD (University of California, Davis); or UCI (University of California, Irvine). The data was analyzed by looking at each Male vs Female comparison separately at each site by a t-test for gender differences. Thus for one brain region, a Male vs Female comparison was run at 3 sites, and the overlapping significant genes from the three comparisons were reported.

The functions of the cell populations in health and disease regarding the host-mediated tissue destruction are not well understood. To get a first idea, of which genes might play a distinct role in chronic periodontal disease in vivo, we compared the genom-wide gene expressions of chronic inflamed and healthy periodontal ligament cells by microarray analysis and validated the data by real-time RT-PCR. The expression rates of 14.239 genes were investigated and 3.018 of them were found differentially expressed by at least two-fold, the expression rates of 1.451 genes were significantly up-regulated and the expression rates of 1.567 genes were significantly down-regulated in inflamed PDL cells. We focused on mainly structural components, for example, laminins and integrins, as well as degrading enzymes, for example, MMPs and cathepsins. The molecular composition of the laminin network varies in chronic inflamed compared to healthy PDL cells in vivo. Furthermore, integrin alpha6beta4, together with laminin-332, might be involved in chronic periodontal inflammation. Findings that diverse keratins were upregulated in chronic disease indicate that the epithelial cell rests of Malassez might also be involved in chronic periodontal inflammation. Also cathepsin B and cathepsin C might participate in the connective tissue destruction. The microarray analysis has identified a profile of genes potentially involved in chronic periodontal inflammation in vivo. Further studies are needed to entirely understand cellular activities during chronic periodontal inflammation in vivo. Experiment Overall Design: Periodontal tissue was collected from 32 patients at the Dental Medical School of the University of Goettingen (12 men, 20 women, aged between 18 and 72 years) from March 2005 to Dezember 2005.

"GSE6490"	"Transcription profiling of Drosophila CA/AA time course of y w"	"Circadian clocks are temporally aligned to the environment via signals, or Zeitgebers, such as daily light and temperature cycles, food availability, and social behavior. In this study, we show that genome-wide expression profiles from temperature-entrained flies show a dramatic difference in the presence or absence of a thermocycle. Whereas transcription appears to be modified globally by changes in temperature, there is a specific set of transcripts that continue to oscillate in constant conditions following temperature entrainment. These transcripts show a significant overlap with a previously defined set of transcripts oscillating in response to a photocycle. Further, these overlapping transcripts maintain the same mutual phase relationships after entrainment by temperature or light. Comparison of the collective temperature- and light-entrained circadian phases indicates that natural environmental light and temperature cycles cooperatively entrain the circadian clock. These findings suggest that a single transcriptional clock in the adult fly head is able to integrate information from both light and temperature. Experiment Overall Design: y w flies that had been reared in constant darkness initially at 25 C and later in a 12-hr 18 C/ 12-hr 25 C thermocycle for more than 4 days were harvested every four hours during an additional 18 C/25 C thermo cycle (also indicated as a cold/ambient or CA cycle) or an additional day at constant 25 C (also indicated as ambient/ambient or AA) . Relative to time CA0 as the time of the onset of the 18 C cryophase or AA0 as the time of the onset of the subjective cryophase during constant 25 C, samples were collected in a CA2- CA6-CA10-CA14-CA18-CA22 and AA2-AA6-AA10-AA14-AA18-AA22 schedule.

"Invasion of lymphatic vessels is a key step in the metastasis of primary tumour cells to draining lymph nodes. Recent evidence indicates that such metastasis can be facilitated by tumour lymphangiogenesis, although it remains unclear whether this is a consequence of increased lymphatic vessel numbers or alteration in the properties of the vessels themselves. Here we have addressed this important question by comparing the RNA profile of normal dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) with those isolated from tumours of murine T-241/VEGF-C metastatic fibrosarcoma. Our findings reveal significant changes in the expression of some 792 genes in tumour lymphatics (³ 2 fold up/downregulation, p ² 0.05), involving particularly transcripts associated with junctional adhesion, immunomodulation, extracellular matrix and vessel growth/patterning, several of which we have confirmed by RT-PCR and/or immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, this altered phenotype could not be attributed solely to VEGF-C induced lymphoproliferation, as no similar change in gene expression was reported when human LEC were cultured with VEGF-C in vitro. Moreover, we show that a key protein upregulated in the mouse model, namely the tight junction protein Endothelial Cell Specific Adhesion Molecule (ESAM), is similarly upregulated in tumour lymphatic vessels from 2/2 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and 4/4 patients with aggressive bladder carcinoma. These findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized influence of tumour environment on lymphatic gene expression and identify candidate tumour specific vessel markers that may prove valuable for either prognosis or therapy.

"GSE6686"	"Transcription profiling of mouse skeletal muscle after gene transfer by electroporation"	"Abstract; Background: Gene transfer by electroporation (electro gene transfer) to muscle results in high level long term transgenic expression, showing great promise for treatment of e.g. protein deficiency syndromes. However little is known about the effects of electro gene transfer on muscle fibres. We have therefore investigated transcriptional changes through gene expression profile analyses, as well as morphological changes evaluated by histological analysis. Electro gene transfer was obtained using a combination of a short high voltage pulse (HV, 1000 V/cm, 100 @s) followed by a long low voltage pulse (LV, 100 V/cm, 400 ms); a pulse combination optimised for efficient and safe gene transfer. Muscles were transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and excised at 4 hours, 48 hours or 3 weeks after treatment. Results: Differentially expressed genes were investigated by microarray analysis, and descriptive statistics were performed to evaluate the effects of 1) electroporation, 2) DNA injection, and 3) time after treatment. The biological significance of the results was assessed by gene annotation and supervised cluster analysis. Generally, electroporation caused down-regulation of structural proteins e.g. sarcospan and catalytic en-zymes such as phosphoenolpuryvate carboxykinase. Injection of DNA induced down-regulation of intracellular transport proteins e.g. sentrin. The effects on muscle fibres were transient as the expression profiles 3 weeks after treatment were closely related with the control muscles. Most interestingly, no changes in the expression of proteins involved in inflammatory responses or muscle regeneration was detected, indicating limited muscle damage and regeneration. Histological analysis revealed structural changes with loss of cell integrity and striation pattern in some fibres after DNA+HV+LV treatment, while electroporation alone caused minor loss of striation pattern but preservation of cell integrity. Conclusion: The small and transient changes found in the gene expression profiles are of great importance, as this demonstrates that electro gene transfer is safe with minor effects on the muscle host cells. These findings are essential for introducing the electro gene transfer to muscle for clinical use. Indeed the HV+LV pulse combination used have been optimised to ensure highly efficient and safe electro gene transfer.

The goal of this study is to identify a population of genes that are enriched in the renal vesicle (RV) and its derivatives using Wnt4 mutants. Experiment Overall Design: Wnt4 is required for renal vesicle (RV) induction. Therefore, RV and the derivatives (s-shaped body and eventually the mature nephron) are missing in Wnt4 mutants. At E14.5, these structures are present in wildtype kidneys. Transcriptional profile comparison between E14.5 wildtype and Wnt4 mutants therefore identify genes expressed in the RV and derivatives.

"GSE8969"	"Transcription profiling of mouse Nrf2 knockout caused by ROS-mediated insulin/IGF-1 resistance"	"The liver is frequently challenged by surgery-induced metabolic overload, viruses, or toxins, which induce the formation of reactive oxygen species. To determine the effect of oxidative stress on liver regeneration and to identify the underlying signalling pathways, we studied liver repair in mice lacking the Nrf2 transcription factor. In these animals, expression of several cytoprotective enzymes was reduced in hepatocytes, resulting in oxidative stress. As a consequence, tissue damage was aggravated, and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy was delayed. Using in vitro and in vivo studies we identified oxidative stress-induced insulin/insulin-like growth factor resistance as the underlying mechanism. This deficiency impaired the activation of p38 mitogen-activated kinase, Akt kinase, and downstream targets after hepatectomy, resulting in enhanced death and delayed proliferation of hepatocytes. Our results reveal novel roles of Nrf2 in the regulation of growth factor signalling and in tissue repair. In addition, they provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying oxidative stress-induced defects in liver regeneration and thus offer new avenues to improve regeneration in patients with acute or chronic liver damage.

To elucidate the cause of mortality we analyzed the potential role of Sp3 in embryonic heart development. Sp3 null hearts display defective looping at E10.5, and at E14.5 the Sp3 null mutants have developed a range of severe cardiac malformations. In an attempt to position Sp3 in the cardiac developmental hierarchy, we analysed the expression patterns of >15 marker genes in Sp3 null hearts. Expression of Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (Carp) was downregulated prematurely after E12.5, while expression of the other marker genes was not affected. ChIP analysis revealed that Sp3 is bound to the Carp promoter region in vivo. Microarray analysis indicates that small molecule metabolism and cell-cell interactions are the most significantly affected biological processes in E12.5 Sp3 null myocardium. Since the epicardium showed distension from the myocardium, we studied expression of Wt1, a marker for epicardial cells. Wt1 expression was diminished in epicardium-derived cells in the myocardium of Sp3 null hearts. We conclude that Sp3 is required for normal cardiac development, and suggest that it has a crucial role in myocardial differentiation.

"GSE9471"	"Transcription profiling of mouse prefrontal cortex of C57Bl/6J mice at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 3, 9, 15, and 21."	"Background: The prefrontal cortex is important in regulating sleep and mood. Diurnally regulated genes in the prefrontal cortex may be controlled by the circadian system, by the sleep-wake states, or by cellular metabolism or environmental responses. Bioinformatics analysis of these genes will provide insights into a wide-range of pathways that are involved in the pathophysiology of sleep disorders and psychiatric disorders with sleep disturbances. Results: We examined gene expression in the mouse prefrontal cortex at four time points during the 24-hour (12-hour light:12-hour dark) cycle by microarrays, and identified 3,890 transcripts corresponding to 2,927 genes with diurnally regulated expression patterns. We show that 16% of the genes identified in our study are orthologs of identified clock, clock controlled or sleep/wakefulness induced genes in the mouse liver and SCN, rat cortex and cerebellum, or Drosophila head. The diurnal expression patterns were confirmed in 16 out of 18 genes in an independent set of RNA samples. The diurnal genes fall into eight temporal categories with distinct functional attributes, as assessed by the Gene Ontology classification and by the analysis of enriched transcription factor binding sites. Conclusions: Our analysis demonstrates that ~10% of transcripts have diurnally regulated expression patterns in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Functional annotation of these genes will be important for the selection of candidate genes for behavioural mutants in the mouse and for genetic studies of disorders associated with anomalies in the sleep:wake cycle and circadian rhythms.

Flies developed fast ethanol tolerance after single exposure to 50% of ethanol vapor for 40 min. Flies can also develope chronic ethanol tolerance after 5x 40 min exposure to 50% ethanol vapor interspersed with 4x 80 min exposure to 10% ethanol vapor. We used microarray analysis to identify genes involved in the development of fast and chronic ethanol tolerance in Drosophila. More than 600 hundred genes were found to have changed their expression level in response to different ethanol treatment. Among these genes, Homer was picked for further study and is demonstrated that its expression in ellipsoid body is critical for the normal sensitivity and fast toleance to ethanol.

"GSE8775"	"Transcription profiling of Drosophila to investigate mutations increasing life span"	"ABSTRACT; MAGWIRE, MICHAEL MAHLON. Mutations Increasing Drosophila melanogaster; Life Span. (Under the direction of Trudy F. C. Mackay.); Better living conditions and advances in medicine have made it possible for; humans to live considerably longer than before. This has uncovered many; health problems associated with age. By identifying genes involved in the; limitation of life span, we may better understand the processes that lead to aging. In model organisms, we can use mutagenesis to discover mutations that; increase life span, and hence infer that the wild-type allele limits life span by some means. We have assessed longevity in a collection of 1332 co-isogenic gene-trap; P-element insertion lines and determined changes in life span of each insert line relative to the corresponding control line. Significant lines were determined via two different methods of analysis: A 95% confidence interval was established based on deviations of the mutant life spans from the controls and Dunnett s two tailed t-tests were used to examine differences between mutant and control in each individual block. Based on the 95% confidence interval, 139 inserts displayed an increase in life span and 194 inserts a decrease. Using Dunnett's, 70 lines increased in life span, while 270 decreased in life span. An additional 48 increased longevity lines were close enough to meeting Dunnett s criteria to be considered for additional investigation. Combining these two analyses, we chose 83 inserts associated with increased life span for a secondary screen using an; additional twelve replicates. 58 of these lines remained significant. We have; determined the P-element insertion site for 50 of these lines. Starvation resistance, chill coma recovery time and climbing activity were; measured on the lines remaining significant after the the secondary screen to identify pleiotropic effects. A positive correlation was found for males between life span and starvation resistance as well as between life span and chill coma recovery. Females only displayed a correlation between life span and chill coma recovery, which was negative. None of the lines indicated increased fitness for all phenotypes, indicating there may be some type of trade-off. There also appears to be a lot of pleiotropic variation depending on background and sex. Ten of the lines, all with the same parental background, were chosen for a; half-diallel cross to identify epistasis between the mutants. There were; substantial epistatic interactions between all ten lines. Furthermore, males and females displayed vastly different patterns of epistasis, again indicating major differences in life span regulation between the sexes. Finally, a subset of seven of the lines used in the epistatic study, in; addition to the corresponding parental control, were chosen for microarray; analysis to look for possible pathways and novel genes involved in increasing life span. 1,996 probe sets were significant at a false discovery rate q-value; threshold of q < 0.0001. Tukeys tests were carried out for these probe sets to determine how each of the seven mutant backgrounds differed compared to the control and each other. In addition, each mutant background was compared individually with the control to identify any changes in expression. Gene ontologies were determined for each of the lines to identify over-represented biological functions which would indicate possible longevity pathways. Dozens of pathways were suggested, including several novel pathways. Experiment Overall Design: We used seven mutant lines homozygous for a P-element insertion and a control line. All lines were isogenic other than the P-element insert. Males and females were done separately with two replicates for a total of 32 arrays."	"GEO"	"partial"

Abstract; Here, we report a detailed analysis of changes in gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster selected for multiple eological relevant environmental stress resistance traits. We analyzed females from three biological replicates from seven selection regimes and one control regime using whole genome gene expression arrays. Replicated selection lines were selected for resistance to acute heat survival, high temperature knock down, constant 30 C during development, cold shock survival, desiccation and starvation, respectively. Additionally, a set of replicated lines was selected for increased longevity. When compared to gene expression profiles of control lines, we were able to detect consistent selection responses at the transcript level in each specific selection regime and also found a group of differentially expressed genes that were generally changed among all selected lines. Replicated selection lines clustered together, i.e. showed similar changes in gene expression (compared to controls) and thus showed that 10 generations of artificial selection gives a clear signal among gene expression profiles. The changes in gene expression in lines selected for increased longevity, desiccation and starvation resistance, respectively, showed high similarities. Cold resistance selected lines showed little differentiation from controls. Different methods of heat selection (heat survival, heat knock down and constant 30 C) showed little similarity verifying that different mechanism are involved in high temperature adaptation. The direction of change in gene expression in the selected lines showed a consistent pattern for each selection regime. For most selection regimes and in the comparison of all selected lines and controls exclusively up- or down regulation of gene expression among significant differentially expressed genes was found. The different responses to selection expressed in individual selection regimes and among all selected lines indicate that we have identified genes involved in stress specific and general stress response mechanisms.

"GSE7614"	"Transcription profiling of Drosophila artificially selected for alcohol sensitivity, highly sensitive or resistant flies vs. unselected control lines"	"Alcoholism is a complex disorder determined by interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors. Drosophila represents a powerful model system to dissect the genetic architecture of alcohol sensitivity, as large numbers of flies can readily be reared in defined genetic backgrounds and under controlled environmental conditions. Furthermore, flies exposed to ethanol undergo physiological and behavioral changes that resemble human alcohol intoxication, including loss of postural control, sedation, and development of tolerance. We performed artificial selection for alcohol sensitivity for 25 generations and created duplicate selection lines that are either highly sensitive or resistant to ethanol exposure along with unselected control lines. We used whole genome expression analysis to identify 1,678 probe sets with different expression levels between the divergent lines, pooled across replicates, at a false discovery rate of q < 0.001. We assessed to what extent genes with altered transcriptional regulation might be causally associated with ethanol sensitivity by measuring alcohol sensitivity of 37 co-isogenic P-element insertional mutations in 35 candidate genes, and found that 32 of these mutants differed in sensitivity to ethanol exposure from their co-isogenic controls. Furthermore, 23 of these novel genes have human orthologues. Combining whole genome expression profiling with selection for genetically divergent lines is an effective approach for identifying candidate genes that affect complex traits, such as alcohol sensitivity. Because of evolutionary conservation of function, it is likely that human orthologues of genes affecting alcohol sensitivity in Drosophila may contribute to alcohol-associated phenotypes in humans. Experiment Overall Design: Starting with flies from Raleigh natural population (see material and methods) we performed artificial selection for alcohol sensitivity for 35 generation. In each generations we scored 60 males and females, separately, from each line (resistant, sensitive, and control)using inebriometer, and the 20 highest-scoring flies from the resistant lines and the 20 lowest-scoring flies from the sensitive lines were selected as parents for the next generation. Control line flies were scored each generation and 20 random flies were used as parents.

"GSE6515"	"Transcription profiling of Drosophila mutant and wild type embryos toinvestigate axon guidance"	"During the development of the Drosophila central nervous system the process of midline crossing is orchestrated by a number of guidance receptors and ligands. Many key axon guidance molecules have been identified in both invertebrates and vertebrates, but the transcriptional regulation of growth cone guidance remains largely unknown. One open question is whether transcriptional regulation plays a role in midline crossing, or if local translation can account for the necessary fine tuning of protein levels. To investigate this issue, we conducted a genome wide analysis of transcription in Drosophila embryos using wild type and a number of well-characterized Drosophila guidance mutants and transgenics. We also analyzed a publicly available microarray time course of Drosophila embryonic development with an axon guidance focus. Using hopach, a novel clustering method which is well suited to microarray data analysis, we identified groups of genes with similar expression patterns across guidance mutants and transgenics. We then systematically characterized the resulting clusters with respect to their relevance to axon guidance using two complementary controlled vocabularies: the Gene Ontology (GO) and anatomical annotations of the Atlas of Pattern of Gene Expression (APoGE) in situ hybridization database. The analysis indicates that regulation of gene expression does play a role in the process of axon guidance in Drosophila. We also find a strong link between axon guidance and hemocyte migration, a result that agrees with mounting evidence that axon guidance molecules are co-opted in vertebrate vascularization. Cell cyclin activity in the context of axon guidance is also suggested from our array data. RNA and protein patterns of cell cyclin in axon guidance mutants and transgenics support this possible link. This study provides important insights into the regulation of axon guidance in vivo and suggests that transcription does play a role in control of axon guidance. Experiment Overall Design: Several mutants and transgenics were analyzed, totalizing 17 distinct conditions. Individual descriptions are included in each microarray. For each condition there are 3 or 4 replicates. The file's name indicates the replicates, e.g., comm.a reflects the replicate a of mutant commissureless.

"GSE10264"	"Transcription profiling of Drosophila Hr39 mutant females reveals the sf1-related nuclear hormone receptor hr39 regulates Drosophila female reproductive tract development and function"	"The vertebrate nuclear hormone receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1; NR5A1) controls reproductive development and regulates the transcription of steroid-modifying cytochrome P450 genes. We find that the SF1-related Drosophila nuclear hormone receptor HR39 is also essential for sexual development. In Hr39 mutant females, the sperm-storing spermathecae and glandular parovaria are absent or defective, causing sterility. Our results indicate that spermathecae and parovaria secrete reproductive tract proteins required for sperm maturation and function, like the mammalian epididymis and female reproductive tract. Hr39 controls the expression of specific cytochrome P450 genes and is required in females both to activate spermathecal secretion and repress male-specific courtship genes such as takeout. Thus, a pathway that, in vertebrates, controls sex-specific steroid hormone production, also mediates reproductive functions in an invertebrate. Our findings suggest that Drosophila can be used to model more aspects of mammalian reproductive biology than previously believed.

"GSE8892"	"Transcription profiling of Drosophila isogenic lines at two embryonic time points to identify gene expression variation underlying evolutionary traits"	"Variation in gene expression may underlie many important evolutionary traits. However, it is not known at what stage in organismal development changes in gene expression are most likely to result in changes in phenotype. One widely held belief is that changes in early development are more likely to results in changes in downstream phenotypes. In order to discover how much genetic variation for transcript level is present in natural populations, we studied zygotic gene expression in nine inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster at two time points in development. We find abundant variation for transcript level both between lines and over time: close to half of all expressed genes show a significant line effect at either time point. We examine the contribution of maternally-loaded genes to this variation, as well as the contribution of variation in upstream genes to variation in their downstream targets in two well-studied gene regulatory networks. Finally, we estimate the dimensionality of gene expression in these two networks and find that despite large numbers of varying genes there only appear to be two factors controlling this variation.

"GSE8938"	"Transcription profiling of Drosophila infected with the parasitoid wasps Leptopilina boulardi and L. heterotoma to investigate infection strategies"	"Although host-parasitoid interactions are becoming well characterized at the organismal and cellular levels, much remains to be understood of the molecular bases for the host immune response and the parasitoids ability to defeat this immune response. Leptopilina boulardi and L. heterotoma, two closely related, highly infectious natural parasitoids of Drosophila melanogaster, appear to use very different infection strategies at the cellular level. Here, we further characterize cellular level differences in the infection characteristics of these two wasp species using newly derived, virulent inbred strains, and then use whole genome microarrays to compare the transcriptional response of Drosophila to each. While flies attacked by the melanogaster group specialist Leptopilina boulardi (strain Lb17) up-regulate numerous genes encoding proteolytic enzymes, components of the Toll and JAK/STAT pathways, and the melanization cascade as part of a combined cellular and humoral innate immune response, flies attacked by the generalist L. heterotoma (strain Lh14) do not appear to initiate an immune transcriptional response at the time points post-infection we assayed, perhaps due to the rapid venom-mediated lysis of host hemocytes (blood cells). Thus, the specialist parasitoid appears to invoke a full-blown immune response in the host, but suppresses and/or evades downstream components of this response. Given that activation of the host immune response likely depletes the energetic resources of the host, the specialist s infection strategy seems relatively disadvantageous. However, we uncover the mechanism for one potentially important fitness tradeoff of the generalist's highly immune suppressive infection strategy. Experiment Overall Design: The parasitoid wasps L. boulardi and L. heterotoma were allowed to attack late second instar D. melanogaster larvae (72 hrs old at 22 C) in the following manner. Nine petri dishes containing 60 fly larvae were each exposed to six experienced L. boulardi (strain Lb17) female wasps for 2 hrs, another nine plates were exposed to five L. heterotoma (strain Lh14) females, and nine control plates were left uninfected. For each of three time points post-infection (2-5 hrs, 9-12 hrs, 21-24 hrs), 40 larvae from three replicate plates were removed and frozen at -80 C for RNA extraction and microarray analysis (3 treatments x 3 time points x 3 replicates = 27 samples total)."

Starved mutant larvae consume glycogen normally, but retain lipids in their midgut and fat body, and have increased levels of long chain fatty acids, suggesting that they are unable to efficiently mobilize stored fat for energy. HNF4 dependent transcripts were identified under fed and starved conditions. Microarray studies indicate reduced expression of genes that control lipid catabolism and -oxidation. Late second instar control and HNF4 mutant larvae were collected and fed or starved for 24 hours, and then RNA was isolated for analysis. Taken together, our results support a feed-forward model for dHNF4, in which fatty acids released from triglycerides activate the receptor, inducing enzymes that drive fatty acid oxidation for energy production. Experiment Overall Design: Staged late second instar control larvae that were transheterozygous for precise excisions of the EP2449 and KG08976 P-elements, and dHNF4D33/dHNF4D17 mutant larvae, were either fed or starved for 24 hrs in a 55mm petri dish containing Whatman paper soaked with PBS.

The goal of this study is to identify genes expressed during the morphogenesis of the nephron. By profiling two specific developmental nephron structures, we expect to identify genes expressed in both, and unique to each, which suggests they may play a role in the underlying mechanism responsible for the morphogenesis. Experiment Overall Design: Two early nephron structures, the renal vesicle and the s-shaped body, and the collecting duct system, were microdissected from E14.5 kidneys based on morphological criteria. Antibody and lectin staining together with RT-PCR were used for identity verification and for exclusion of contamination by other tissues. Samples are minimally pooled for amplification. A biological replicate is a single minimally pooled sample. RNA isolated from the collected structures was put through two rounds of T7-driven amplification to obtain the microgram quantities of cRNA needed for hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays.

Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene in laser capture microdissected components of the developing kidney.

"GSE3216"	"Transcription profiling of mouse small intestinal crypt-villus axis"	"Genes encoding transcription factors function as hubs in gene regulatory networks because they encode DNA-binding proteins, which bind to promoters that carry their binding sites. In the present work we have studied gene regulatory networks defined by genes with transcripts belonging to different mRNA abundance classes in the small intestinal epithelial cell. The focus is the rewiring that occurs in transcription factor hubs in these networks during the differentiation of the small intestinal epithelial cell while it migrates along the crypt-villus axis and during its development from a fetal endodermal cell to a mature adult villus epithelial cell. We have generated transcriptome data for mouse small intestinal villus, crypt and fetal intestinal epithelial cells. In addition we have generated metabolome data from crypt and villus cells. Our results show that the intestinal crypt transcription factor hubs that are rewired during differentiation are involved in the cell cycle process (E2F, NF-Y) and stem cell maintenance (c-Myc). In contrast the villi are dominated by a HNF-4 villus hub, which is rewired during differentiation by the addition of network genes with relevance for lipoprotein synthesis and lipid absorption. Moreover, we have identified a villus NF-kB hub, which was revealed by comparison of the villus and endoderm transcriptomes. The rewiring of the NF-kB villus hub during intestinal development reflects transcriptional activity established by host and microflora interactions. To aid in the mining of our results we have developed a web portal (http://gastro.imbg.ku.dk/mousecv/) allowing easy linkage between the transcriptomic data, biological processes and functions.

This observation led us to speculate that the differences between embryonic trachea and lung are defined by limited subset of genes, and that the molecular comparison of these two tissues might provide new information on genes that are important for both lung and trachea development. Microarray experiments designed to identify genes differentially expressed in the E11.5 lung and trachea showed that melanoma inhibitory activity (Mia1) was expressed only in the lung. Mia1 was abundantly expressed during early lung development, but was virtually absent by the end of gestation. Bitransgenic mice expressing MIA under the control of the SFTPC promoter after E16.5, the age when Mia1 is normally silenced, died from respiratory failure at birth with morphologically immature lungs associated with reduced levels of saturated phosphatidylcholine and mature SP-B. Microarray analysis showed significant reductions expression of Sftpa, Sftpb, Abca3, Aqp5, Lzp-s, Scd2, and Aytl2 in lungs misexpressing MIA.

Beginning around E10 of mouse development the prominences undergo rapid growth and morphogenesis. By E11.5 the medial nasal prominences are in close apposition in the midline, as are the maxillary and medial nasal prominences on either side of the developing face. Subsequently, by E12.5 the nasal and maxillary prominences fuse to form a continuous shelf at the front of the face - the primary palate. Individual prominences are associated with specific developmental processes, and this is reflected by patterns of differential gene expression that give the prominences their unique identities. Thus, only the mandibular and maxillary prominences give rise to dentition while the frontonasal prominence has a unique role in olfaction, and the mandibular prominence in taste. We used microarrays to detail the differential gene expression program in each of the mandibular, maxillary, and frontonasal prominences during the key developmental timepoints of E10.0 through E12.5. Experiment Overall Design: Analysis of gene expression during growth and fusion of the facial prominences in the C57BL/6J mouse strain between embryonic (E) day 10.0 and 12.5. At the earliest timepoint, E10, only the mandibular prominence is a distinct entity that can be readily identified and dissected. The frontonasal prominence and the maxillary prominence are very small and not discrete from other components of the head such as the forebrain until E10.5. Analysis of these tissues at earlier timepoints would require laser capture and preamplification steps - techniques that were not used for the later timepoints. Thus samples were isolated from the mandibular prominence at E10.0 and from the mandibular, maxillary and frontonasal prominences of mouse embryos from E10.5 to E12.5, at 0.5 day intervals. In order to obtain sufficient sample for hybridization, each sample represents a pool of between 3 and 48 embryos depending on the timepoint.

"GSE6476"	"Transcription profiling of mouse hippocampus after chronic fluoxetine treatment"	"Both the mechanism of action and the factors determining the behavioral response to antidepressants are unknown. It has been shown that antidepressant treatment promotes the proliferation and survival of hippocampal neurons via enhanced serotonergic signaling, but it is still unclear whether hippocampal neurogenesis is responsible for the behavioral response to antidepressants. Furthermore, a large subpopulation of patients fails to respond to antidepressant treatment due to presumed underlying genetic factors. In the present study, we have used the phenotypic and genotypic variability of inbred mouse strains to show that there is a genetic component to both the behavioral and neurogenic effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment, and that this antidepressant induces an increase in hippocampal cell proliferation only in the strains that also show a positive behavioral response to treatment. The behavioral and neurogenic responses are associated with an upregulation of genes known to promote neuronal proliferation and survival. These results suggest that inherent genetic predisposition to increased serotonin-induced neurogenesis is a determinant of antidepressant efficacy. Experiment Overall Design: Male DBA/2J, age 3-5 weeks, were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained on a 12:12 light:dark cycle with lights on at 0700 hours. Following at least one week of acclimation, mice were provided with either untreated or fluoxetine-treated drinking water, available ad libitum. Fluoxetine-HCl was obtained from Spectrum Chemicals (Gardena, CA). Differences in daily water consumption were previously determined by measuring water intake for three weeks from at least 12 mice (6.4 mL (+/- .58 mL) per day). We also determined the average weight at 10 weeks of age (25.5 g +/- 1.4 g), and used this information to dilute fluoxetine in the water in order to provide a daily dosage of 0 or 18 mg/kg/mouse. Experiment Overall Design: Mice were 8-12 weeks of age at the time of behavioral testing, which was performed during the light phase between 1300h and 1600h. Behavioral despair was measured using a mouse Tail Suspension apparatus from Med Associates (Georgia, VT).

RNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform phase separation and further processed using the RNAeasy miniprep kit (QIAgen). For each treatment group of 12 animals, separate RNA pools were made using hippocampal RNA from 6 mice per pool. These biological replicates were processed separately through the entirety of the microarray procedure. Five g of total RNA from each pool was used as a template to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) and biotinylated cRNA (Enzo kit, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using standard Affymetrix protocols. cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. Data were analyzed using ArrayAssist software (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and normalized with the GCRMA algorithm. A probeset had to obtain a minimal intensity value 100 to be considered as detecting expression above background. Therefore, any probeset that failed to meet this cutoff was removed from the analysis.

"GSE7536"	"Transcription profiling of mouse discrete microdissected inner ear tissues from E9 to E15 at half-day intervals."	"The inner ear in mammals is derived from a simple ectodermal thickening called the otic placode. Through a series of complex morphological changes, the placode forms the mature inner ear comprising of the auditory organ (cochlea) and the vestibular/balance organs (utricle, saccule, and three semi-circular canals). The vast majority of genes known to be involved during inner ear development have been found through mutational screens or by chance. To identify genes that can serve as novel candidates required for inner ear development, and also candidate genes for uncloned human deafnesses, inner ear tissues from mouse embryos from E9 to E15 were microdissected and expression-profiled at half-day intervals. Also profiled was the non-inner ear mesenchymal tissue surrounding the inner ear tissue. Various patterns of gene expression were identified, and significant biological pathways that these genes represented were identified. Also identified were mouse genes whose human orthologs are located within uncloned non-syndromic deafness intervals, thus serving as candidates for sequence analysis. Experiment Overall Design: Inner ear tissues from E9 to E15 were microdissected at half-day intervals. E9 is the earliest stage when the otic placode is clearly visible and able to be microdissected cleanly. E15 is the stage when all the organs of the inner ear have become established, as have the sensory hair and non-sensory support cells within those organs. For each of the stages from E9 to E10, whole inner ears were profiled. For each of the stages from E10.5 to E12, the primordial cochlear and vestibular organs were profiled separately. For each of the stages from E12.5 to E15, the cochlea and the saccule were profiled separately, whereas the utricle and the three ampullae were combined and profiled together. Any given tissue from any given stage was a collection of anywhere between 4 to 17 identical tissues, and was obtained in duplicate (i.e. from different litters). Hence, a total of 58 inner ear samples were obtained. Moreover, non-inner ear tissue found in the immediate vicinity of inner ear tissue was also obtained and profiled. Specifically, all non-inner ear tissue from E9 was profiled in duplicate.

Here it was proposed to participate in lowering the cytoplasmic Cl- concentration of neurons, a process that establishes an inhibitory response to the neurotransmitters GABA and glycine (Staley et al., 1996). Heterozygous mutations in CLCN2 (the gene encoding ClC-2) were recently reported in a few patients with three clinically distinct forms of epilepsy (Haug et al, 2003). However, the disruption of ClC-2 in mice (ClC-2 KO mouse) did not entail epilepsy (B sl et al., 2001; Nehrke et al., 2002) but myelin vacuolation in fiber tracts of the central nervous system. We used a gene expression profiling of the ClC-2 KO mouse in brain to identify possible disease mechanism which cause the observed myelin phenotype. As these myelin vacuolation became apparent in the fiber tracts of ClC-2 KO cerebellum at P28 and increased with age, we analysed the cerebellum of ClC-2 KO mice at different postnatal ages, before (P14) and after (P35) the KO cerebellum has been affected by myelin vacuolation."

"GSE13512"	"Transcription profiling of mouse hypomorphic for ATG16L1 (implicated in Crohns disease) protein expression reveals a key role for autophagy and the autophagy gene Atg16l1 in mouse and human intestinal Paneth cells"	"Susceptibility to Crohn's disease, a complex inflammatory disease involving the small intestine, is controlled by over 30 loci. One Crohn's disease risk allele is in ATG16L1, a gene homologous to the essential yeast autophagy gene ATG16 (ref. 2). It is not known how ATG16L1 or autophagy contributes to intestinal biology or Crohn's disease pathogenesis. To address these questions, we generated and characterized mice that are hypomorphic for ATG16L1 protein expression, and validated conclusions on the basis of studies in these mice by analysing intestinal tissues that we collected from Crohn's disease patients carrying the Crohn's disease risk allele of ATG16L1. Here we show that ATG16L1 is a bona fide autophagy protein. Within the ileal epithelium, both ATG16L1 and a second essential autophagy protein ATG5 are selectively important for the biology of the Paneth cell, a specialized epithelial cell that functions in part by secretion of granule contents containing antimicrobial peptides and other proteins that alter the intestinal environment. ATG16L1- and ATG5-deficient Paneth cells exhibited notable abnormalities in the granule exocytosis pathway. In addition, transcriptional analysis revealed an unexpected gain of function specific to ATG16L1-deficient Paneth cells including increased expression of genes involved in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling and lipid metabolism, of acute phase reactants and of two adipocytokines, leptin and adiponectin, known to directly influence intestinal injury responses. Importantly, Crohn's disease patients homozygous for the ATG16L1 Crohn's disease risk allele displayed Paneth cell granule abnormalities similar to those observed in autophagy-protein-deficient mice and expressed increased levels of leptin protein. Thus, ATG16L1, and probably the process of autophagy, have a role within the intestinal epithelium of mice and Crohn's disease patients by selective effects on the cell biology and specialized regulatory properties of Paneth cells. Experiment Overall Design: 4 Samples: 2 replicates of Atg16-hypomorph Paneth cells and 2 replicates of Wildtype Paneth cells."	"GEO"	"partial"		
"GSE8091"	"Transcription profiling and proteomic of mouse early embryonic brain development"	"Embryonic mouse brain development involves a sequential differentiation of multipotent progenitor cells into neurons and glia. Using microarrays and large 2-D electrophoresis, we investigated the transcriptome and proteome of mouse brains at embryonic days 9.5, 11.5 and 13.5. During this developmental period, neural progenitor cells shift from proliferation to neuronal differentiation. As expected, we detected numerous expression changes between the time points investigated but interestingly, the rate of alteration was about 10% to 13% of all proteins and mRNAs during every two days of development. Furthermore, up- and downregulation was balanced. This was confirmed for two additional stages of development, embryonic day 16 and 18. We hypothesize that during embryonic development, the rate of protein expression alteration is rather constant due to a limitation of cellular resources such as energy, space and free water. The similar complexity found at the transcriptome and proteome level at all stages suggests, that changes in relative concentration of gene products rather than an increased number of gene products dominate throughout cellular differentiation. We found that metabolism and cell cycle related gene products were downregulated in expression when precursor cells switched from proliferation to neuronal differentiation (day 9.5 to 11.5), whereas neuron specific gene products were upregulated. A detailed analysis revealed their implication in differentiation related processes such as rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton as well as Notch and Wnt signaling pathways.

The zinc finger transcription factor GATA4 functions as an integral member of the cardiac transcription factor network in the SHF and its derivatives. In addition to its role in cardiac differentiation, GATA4 is also required for cardiomyocyte replication, although the transcriptional targets of GATA4 required for proliferation have not been previously identified. In the present study, we disrupted Gata4 function exclusively in the SHF and its derivatives. Gata4 SHF knockout mice die by embryonic day 13.5 and exhibit hypoplasia of the right ventricular myocardium and interventricular septum and display profound ventricular septal defects. Loss of Gata4 function in the SHF results in decreased myocyte proliferation in the right ventricle, and we identify numerous cell cycle genes that are dependent on Gata4 by microarray analysis. We show that Gata4 is required for Cyclin D2 expression in the right ventricle and that the Cyclin D2 promoter is bound and activated by GATA4 via three consensus GATA binding sites. These findings establish Cyclin D2 as a direct transcriptional target of GATA4 and support a model in which GATA4 controls cardiomyocyte proliferation by coordinately regulating numerous cell cycle genes.

"GSE11952"	"Transcription profiling of human small airway epithelium responsive to smoking reveas coordinate control of Nrf2 mediated genes"	"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2, Nrf2) is an oxidant responsive transcription factor known to induce phase 2 detoxifying and antioxidant genes to protect cells from oxidative stress. Cigarette smoke, with its large oxidant content, is a major stressor to the small airway epithelium, the cells of which are vulnerable to oxidant damage and consequent malignant transformation. In this study, we assessed the role of cigarette smoke in activation of Nrf2 in the human small airway epithelium in vivo. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used to sample a pure population of small airway epithelium in 38 healthy nonsmokers and 45 healthy smokers, and gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. Compared to that of healthy nonsmokers, Nrf2 protein was significantly activated in the small airway epithelium of healthy normal smokers and localized in the nucleus (p<0.05). Of the human homologs of 201 known murine Nrf2-mediated genes, 13 highly smoking-responsive genes were identified (p<10-4, all comparisons smokers to nonsmokers). Using a Nrf2-index to quantify the extent of expression in the small airway epithelium of these 13 known Nrf2 genes, variability in the level of expression was observed among the 45 healthy smokers, but the variability was coordinately modulated among the 13 genes, an observation confirmed by TaqMan quantitative PCR. This variability in the coordinate level of expression of the 13 Nrf2-mediated genes was independent of the smoking history. Based on these observations, the Nrf2 index was used to evaluate whether other genes modulated by smoking in the small airway epithelium were also coordinately up- or down- modulated among the 45 healthy smokers. Two genes, pirin (PIR) and UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family polypeptide A4 (UGT1A4), not previously known to be modulated by Nrf2 were identified as being coordinately modulated among the 45 smokers. Both genes contain several functional antioxidant response elements in the promoter region. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, these antioxidant response elements in the promoters of PIR and UGT1A4 responded in vitro to activated Nrf2. These observations are consistent with the concept that Nrf2 plays an important role in regulating cellular defenses against smoking in the highly vulnerable small airway epithelium cell population, and that there is variability among the population in the relative Nrf2 responsiveness to a similar oxidant burden.

We performed euglycemic hyperinsulinemic (80 mU/m2/min) clamps in 12 healthy, insulin sensitive subjects with no family history of diabetes followed by biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle taken basally and after 30 and 240 minutes of insulin infusion. Gene expression profiles were generated using Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays. No probe sets had significantly altered expression at 30 minutes of the insulin clamp, but 121 probe sets (117 upregulated and 4 downregulated) were significantly altered after 240 minutes. Hyperinsulinemia in normal, healthy human subjects increased the mRNAs for a number of inflammatory genes and transcription factors. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR revealed the upregulation of chemokine, cc motif, ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL8, thrombomodulin (THBD), ras-related associated with diabetes (RRAD), metallothionein (MT), and serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase (SGK), and downregulation of CITED2 (a CREB-binding protein-interacting transactivator), a known coactivator of PPAR-alpha. Interestingly, SGK and CITED2 are located at chromosome 6q23, where we previously detected strong linkage to hyperinsulinemia. A control saline infusion performed on 3 normal, healthy subjects without a family history of diabetes demonstrated that the genes altered following the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp were due to insulin and independent of biopsy removal.

Microarray analysis of LPS-stimulated whole blood from RA patients pre and post anti-TNF treatment was conducted. This study identified 818 transcripts, differentially expressed in RA patients pre-treatment compared to non-RA control samples. While a number of these genes were associated with RA in previous studies, validating our data, a number of novel genes with possible functions in RA disease were also identified. The number of transcripts (1051) significantly altered post anti-TNF treatment indicates the impact of anti-TNF therapy on systemic gene expression. A number of these transcripts were confirmed to be altered in a larger patient group and may represent potential genetic markers of a patient s clinical response to anti-TNF treatment. Experiment Overall Design: Transcriptome profiling was performed on two RA patients, pre- and three months post-Enbrel therapy and two matched non-RA controls.

"GSE7476"	"Transcription profiling of human bladder cancers to develop a clinical classification according to microarray expression profiles"	"Using Affymetrix microarray technology we analyzed the gene expression profiles of the most important pathological categories of bladder cancer in order to detect potential marker genes. Applying an unsupervised cluster algorithm we observed clear differences between tumor and control samples, as well as between superficial and muscle invasive tumors. According to cluster results, the T1 high grade tumor type presented a global genetic profile which could not be distinguished from invasive cases. We described a new measure to classify differentially expressed genes and we compared it against the B-rank statistic as a standard method. According to this new classification method, the biological functions overrepresented in top differentially expressed genes when comparing tumor versus control samples were associated with growth, differentiation, immune system response, communication, cellular matrix and enzyme regulation. Comparing superficial versus invasive samples, the most important overrepresented biological category was growth and, specifically, DNA synthesis and mitotic cytoskeleton. On the other hand, some under expressed genes have been clearly related to muscular tissue contamination in control samples. Finally, we demonstrated that a pool strategy could be a good option to detect the best differentially expressed genes between two compared conditions. Experiment Overall Design: We analyzed gene expression profiles in normal bladder tissues (controls), low grade superficial tumor samples (pathologically classified as Ta low grade, named as Ta), high grade superficial tumors with an unclear clinical behavior (T1 high grade, named as T1) and high grade muscle invasive tumors (pathologically classified as T2, T3 or T4, named as T2+). We analyzed data using a sub-pooling strategy. The number of individual samples on every pool was: controls (4, 4, 4), Ta (5, 5, 5), T1 (5, 4, 4) and T2+ (5, 5, 5)."	"GEO"	"partial"

In an attempt to understand the specific genes involved in inflammatory acne, we performed gene expression profiling in acne patients. Skin biopsies were obtained from an inflammatory papule and from normal skin in six patients with acne. Biopsies were also taken from normal skin of six subjects without acne. Gene array expression profiling was conducted using Affymetrix HG-U133A 2.0 arrays comparing lesional to nonlesional skin in acne patients and comparing nonlesional skin from acne patients to skin from normal subjects. Within the acne patients, 211 genes are upregulated in lesional skin compared to nonlesional skin. A significant proportion of these genes are involved in pathways that regulate inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling, and they include matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3, IL-8, human beta-defensin 4, and granzyme B. These data indicate a prominent role of matrix metalloproteinases, inflammatory cytokines, and antimicrobial peptides in acne lesions. These studies are the first describing the comprehensive changes in gene expression in inflammatory acne lesions and are valuable in identifying potential therapeutic targets in inflammatory acne.

Relative transcript levels were determined using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Plus 2.0 arrays. Sex determination occurs in the human gonad at approximately 6 weeks; gestation with development of the testis driven by expression of SRY. In this study, SRY transcript was present and elevated at 9 weeks gestation in the testis but absent in the ovary. The transcript levels of other testis-specific factors SOX9, AMH, and the steroidogenic genes CYP17a1, CYP11a1, STAR and HSD17 3 were all significantly higher in the testis. In contrast, transcripts known to be involved in meiosis including STRA8, SPO11, SYCP3, TEX11, TEX14 and STAG3 showed highest expression in the fetal ovary beginning at week 12.

CD24 may be important in human embryonic kidney epithelial cell differentiation. In mice, CD24 expression is up-regulated in the early metanephros and localized to developing epithelial structures but the role and expression of CD24 in the developing human kidney has not been well described. In normal human fetal kidneys from 8 to 38 weeks gestation, CD24 expression was up-regulated and restricted to the early epithelial aggregates of the metanephric blastema and to the committed proliferating tubular epithelia of the S-shape nephron; however individual CD24+ cells were identified in the interstitium of later gestation and postnatal kidneys. In freshly isolated cells, FACS analysis demonstrated distinct CD24+ and CD24+133+ cell populations, constituting up to 16% and 14% respectively of the total cells analyzed. Isolated and expanded CD24+ clones displayed features of an epithelial progenitor cell line. Early fetal urinary tract obstruction resulted in an upregulation of CD24 expression, both in developing epithelial structures of early gestation kidneys and in the cells of the injured tubular epithelium of the later gestation kidneys. These results highlight the cell specific expression of CD24 in the developing human kidney and dysregulation in fetal urinary tract obstruction.

"GSE11622"	"Transcription profiling of human post menopausal vaginal response and ovarectomised rat treated with estrogens"	"Background. Vaginal atrophy (VA) is the thinning of the vaginal epithelial lining, typically the result of lowered estrogen levels during menopause. Some of the consequences of VA include increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, pain during sexual intercourse, and vaginal burning or itching. Although estrogen treatment is highly effective, alternative therapies are also desired for women who are not candidates for hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The ovariectomized (OVX) rat is widely accepted as an appropriate animal model for many estrogen-dependent responses in humans; however, since reproductive biology can vary significantly between mammalian systems, this study examined how well the OVX rat recapitulates human biology at the transcriptional level. This report describes an analysis of expression profiling data, comparing the responses of rat and human vaginae to estrogen treatment. Results. The level of differential expression between pre- vs. post- estrogen treatment was calculated for each of the human and OVX rat datasets. Probe sets corresponding to orthologous rat and human genes were mapped to each other using NCBI Homologene. A positive correlation was observed between the rat and human responses to estrogen. Genes belonging to several biological pathways and GO categories were similarly differentially expressed in rat and human. A large number of the coordinately regulated biological processes are already known to be involved in human VA, such as inflammation, epithelial development, and EGF pathway activation. Conclusions. At the transcriptional level, there is evidence of significant overlap of the effects of estrogen treatment between the OVX rat and human VA samples.

Following reperfusion, 579 genes in DD grafts and 1324 genes in LDs were differentially expressed (p<0.005). Many up-regulated LD genes were related to regeneration, biosynthesis and cell cycle, and a large number of down-regulated genes were linked to hepatic metabolism and energy pathways correlating with post-transplant clinical laboratory findings. There was significant up-regulation of inflammatory/immune genes in both DD and LD, each with a distinct pattern. Gene expression patterns of select genes associated with inflammation and regeneration in LD and DD grafts correlated with protein expression. Unique patterns of early gene expression are seen in LD and DD liver grafts, correlating with protein expression and clinical results, demonstrating distinct inflammatory profiles and significant down-regulation of metabolic pathways in LD grafts.

"GSE9675"	"Transcription profiling of mouse embryos exposed to diabetes reveals maternal diabetes alters transcriptional programs in the developing embryo"	"Diabetic embryopathy can affect any developing organ system, although cardiovascular malformations, neural tube defects and caudal dysgenesis syndrome are the most prominent congenital malformations. We hypothesize that the metabolic imbalance occurring in diabetic pregnancy de-regulates tissue specific gene expression programs in the developing embryo. In order to identify genes whose expression is affected by maternal diabetes, we analyzed gene expression profiles of diabetes-exposed mouse embryos by using Affymetrix microarrays. We identified 129 genes with altered expression levels; 21 genes had increased and 108 genes had decreased expression levels in diabetes-exposed embryos relative to controls. A substantial fraction of these genes (35) are essential for normal embryonic development as shown by functional studies in mouse models. The largest fraction of diabetes-affected genes was in transcription factor and DNA-binding/chromatin remodeling functional categories (19%), which directly affect transcription. These findings suggest that transcriptional regulation in the developing embryos is perturbed by maternal diabetes and that transcriptional regulation plays a major role in the responses of embryos to intrauterine exposure to diabetic conditions. Interestingly, we found the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (Hif1 ) deregulated in the embryos exposed to the conditions of maternal diabetes. Since hypoxic stress is associated with the complications of diabetic pregnancy, we performed a post-hoc analysis of our microarray data with a specific focus on known HIF1 target genes. Of 39 genes detected in our microarrays, the expression changes of 22 genes (20 were increased and two genes were decreased in diabetes-exposed embryos) were statistically significant. These results indicate that HIF1-regulated pathways are affected in diabetes-exposed embryos. These results strongly suggest that de-regulation of hypoxia/HIF1 activated pathways could be the one of the key molecular events associated with the exposure to the teratogenic intrauterine environment of a diabetic mother. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was isolated from whole embryos at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). Five diabetes-exposed embryos (2 of 5 embryos had neural tube defects; NTD) were compared to two control embryos. Diabetes was induced in female FVB mice (aged 7-9 weeks) by streptozotocin Embryos were isolated only from dams that were classified as diabetic with the blood glucose levels > 250 mg/dl from the mating day until the day of embryo harvest.

Importantly, well-known dominant-negative inhibitors of muscle differentiation, the Id family of genes (Id1/Id2/Id3), were upregulated in the RP58 KO muscle. On the contrary, a number of muscle differentiation-related genes, such as Ckm, troponin and Myosin, were downregulated in the same sample. These results indicate that the repressor protein RP58 is important for muscle terminal differentiation, possibly suppressing the gene expression of muscle differentiation genes such as the Ids.

To better understand the pathogenesis of this disease and to facilitate novel preclinical approaches, we previously developed a conditional mouse model of ARMS by faithfully recapitulating the genetic mutations observed in the human disease, i.e. activation of Pax3:Fkhr fusion gene with either p53 or Cdkn2a inactivation. In this report we show that this model recapitulates the immunohistochemical profile and the rapid progression of the human disease. We demonstrate that Pax3:Fkhr expression increases during late preneoplasia, but that tumor cells undergoing metastasis are under apparent selection for Pax3:Fkhr expression. At a whole genome level, a cross-species gene set enrichment analysis and metagene projection study showed that our mouse model is most similar to human ARMS when compared to other pediatric cancers. We have defined an expression profile conserved between mouse and human ARMS as well as a Pax3:Fkhr signature, including the target gene, SKP2. We further identified 7 druggable kinases over-expressed across species. The data affirms the accuracy of this genetically engineered mouse model.

"GSE11496"	"Transcription profiling of mouse Gcn2 wild-type and knockout liver perfused with or without methionine"	"In eukaryotes, regulation of mRNA translation enables a fast, localized and finely tuned expression of gene products. Within the translation process, the first stage of translation initiation is most rigorously modulated by the actions of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) and their associated proteins. These 11 eIFs catalyze the joining of the tRNA, mRNA and rRNA into a functional translation complex. Their activity is influenced by a wide variety of extra- and intracellular signals, ranging from global, such as hormone signaling and unfolded proteins, to specific, such as single amino acid imbalance and iron deficiency. Their action is correspondingly comprehensive, in increasing or decreasing recruitment and translation of most cellular mRNAs, and specialized, in targeting translation of mRNAs with regulatory features such as a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP), upstream open reading frames (uORFs), or an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). In mammals, two major pathways are linked to targeted mRNA translation. The target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase induces translation of TOP and perhaps other subsets of mRNAs, whereas a family of eIF2 kinases does so with mRNAs containing uORFs or an IRES. TOR targets translation of mRNAs that code for proteins involved in translation, an action compatible with its widely accepted role in regulating cellular growth. The four members of the eIF2 kinase family increase translation of mRNAs coding for stress response proteins such as transcription factors and chaperones. Though all four kinases act on one main substrate, eIF2, published literature demonstrates both common and unique effects by each kinase in response to its specific activating stress. This suggests that the activated eIF2 kinases regulate the translation of both a global and a specific set of mRNAs. Up to now, few studies have attempted to test such a hypothesis; none has been done in mammals. We use array analysis to determine the global mRNA shift into polysomes following a stress response, and to compare the translational response following activation of GCN2 versus PERK, two of the four eIF2alpha kinases. Experiment Overall Design: Gcn2 wild-type or knockout mouse liver were perfused with complete amino acids media or media lacking methionine for RNA extraction and hybridization of Affymetrix microarrays.

To study the role of Apc in mammary tumorigensis, we introduced conditional Apc mutations specifically into two different mammary epithelial populations using K14-Cre (progenitor) and WAP-cre (lactaing luminal) transgenic mice. Only the K14-cre mediated Apc heterozygosity developed mammary adenocarcinomas demonstrating histological and molecular heterogeneity, suggesting the progenitor cell origin of these tumors. These tumors harbored truncation mutation in a very defined region in the remaining wild-type allele of Apc that would retain some down-regulating activity of beta-catenin signaling. Our results suggest that not only the epithelial origin but also a certain Apc mutations are selected to achieve a specific level of beta -catenin signaling optimal for mammary tumor development. Experiment Overall Design: We have compared 3 mammary tumors from K14-cre; ApcCKO/+ mice with 3 control mammary glands."	"GEO"	"partial"		
"GSE18160"	"Kidney Stone Induces Developmental Stage-specific Alterations in Gene Expression"	"OBJECTIVES: Kidney stone diseases are common in premature infants, but the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are not fully defined. We carried out a prospective observational study using microarray analysis to identify factors that may be crucial for the initiation and progression of stone-induced injury in the developing mouse kidney. METHODS: Mice with adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Aprt) deficiency develop 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (DHA) nephrolithiasis. Gene expression changes between Aprt-/- and Aprt+/+ kidneys from newborn and adult mice were compared using Affymetrix gene chips. RESULTS: We observed that: (i) gene expression changes induced by Aprt deficiency are developmental stage-specific; (ii) maturation-related gene expression changes are delayed in developing Aprt-/- kidneys; and (iii) immature Aprt-deficient kidneys contain large numbers of intercalated cells blocked from terminal differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a comprehensive picture of the transcriptional changes induced by stone injury in the developing mouse kidney. Our findings help explain growth impairment in kidneys subject to injury during the early stages of development. Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA were extracted from kidneys of 12 newly born and 6 adult mice (half Aprt-/- and half control). Gene expression changes between Aprt-/- and Aprt+/+ kidneys from newborn and adult mice were compared using Affymetrix gene chips."	"GEO"	"partial"

Employing a genome-wide gene expression study, we identified transcription regulators whose expression correlates highly with that of differentiation markers both in bladder and skin, including the Grainyhead factor Get1/Grhl3, already known to be important for epidermal barrier formation. In the bladder, Get1 is most highly expressed in the differentiated umbrella cells and its mutation in mice leads to a defective bladder epithelial barrier formation due to failure of apical membrane specialization. Genes encoding components of the specialized urothelial membrane, the uroplakins, were downregulated in Get1-/- mice. At least one of these genes, Uroplakin II, is a direct target of Get1. The urothelial-specific activation of the Uroplakin II gene is due to selective binding of Get1 to the Uroplakin II promoter in urothelial cells, most likely regulated by histone modifications. These results demonstrate a key role for Get1 in urothelial differentiation and barrier formation. Experiment Overall Design: To gain insights into common and unique transcriptional regulatory programs during epidermal differentiation, we profiled global gene expression in mouse dorsal skin at E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5."

To look at the potential interaction of cell types within the testis following hormone stimulation we have investigated the effect of rFSH on testicular gene expression in the hypogonadal (hpg) male mouse. Due to a deletion in the gene encoding gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), FSH and LH levels are at the lower limit of detection in the circulation and mice remain in a pre-pubertal state throughout life unless given exogenous hormone. Here we have addressed important question of changes in the global gene expression profile of testicular tissue following hormone stimulation (rFSH) for 12, 24 and 72h following injections compared to control untreated hpg males of the same age.

"GSE14869"	"Transcription profiling of mouse liver response to heat shock reveals transcriptional dependence on the nuclear receptor PPARalpha?"	"The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR ) regulates responses to chemical or physical stress in part by altering expression of genes involved in proteome maintenance. Many of these genes are also transcriptionally regulated by heat shock (HS) through activation by HS factor-1 (HSF1). We hypothesized that there are interactions on a genetic level between PPAR and the HS response mediated by HSF1. Wild-type and PPAR -null mice were exposed to HS, the PPAR agonist WY-14,643 (WY), or both; gene and protein expression was examined in the livers of the mice 4 or 24 hrs after HS. Gene expression profiling identified a number of Hsp family members that were altered similarly in both mouse strains. However, most of the targets of HS did not overlap between strains. A subset of genes was shown by microarray and RT-PCR to be regulated by HS in a PPAR -dependent manner. HS also down-regulated a large set of mitochondrial genes specifically in PPAR -null mice that are known targets of PPARg co-activator 1 (PGC-1) family members. Pretreatment of PPAR -null mice with WY increased expression of PGC-1b and target genes and prevented the down-regulation of the mitochondrial genes by HS. A comparison of HS genes regulated in our dataset with those identified in wild-type and HSF1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts indicated that although many HS genes are regulated independently of both PPAR and HSF1, a number require both factors for HS responsiveness. These findings demonstrate that the PPAR genotype has a dramatic effect on the transcriptional targets of HS and support an expanded role for PPAR in the regulation of proteome maintenance genes after exposure to diverse forms of environmental stress including HS.

A majority of the individuals diagnosed with RSTS carry heterozygous mutation in the gene CREBBP, but a small percentage of cases are caused by mutations in EP300. To investigate the contribution of p300 to RSTS pathoetiology, we carried out a comprehensive and multidisciplinary characterization of p300+/- mice. These mice exhibited facial abnormalities and impaired growth, two traits associated to RSTS in humans. We also observed abnormal gait, reduced swimming speed, enhanced anxiety in the elevated plus maze, and mild cognitive impairment during the transfer task in the water maze. These analyses demonstratethat p300+/- mice exhibit phenotypes that are reminiscent of neurological traits observed in RSTS patients, but their comparison with previous studies on CBP deficient strains also indicate that, in agreement with the most recent findings in human patients, the activity of p300 in cognition is likely less relevant or more susceptible to compensation than the activity of CBP. To identify those genes whose expression was altered in the hippocampus of p300 deficient mutants, we performed a gene profiling analysis of hippocampal tissue using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays.

Here we generated mice with a targeted disruption of the periphilin-1 gene to explore its physiological role from an organismic perspective. In accordance with a ubiquitous expression of periphilin in the murine embryo, the homozygous deficiency of periphilin is lethal in early embryogenesis. We therefore characterized mice with a disruption of only one periphilin allele. As heterozygous periphilin knockout mice show no obvious histological alterations and have no apparent behavioural phenotypes, we compared whole transcriptome RNA expression profiles of total brain tissue of periphilin+/- knockout mice and wild type littermates for an in-depth analysis of heterozygous animals. In periphilin+/- knockout mice, 3 probe sets were indicative of significant differential expression (p ² 0.05, SLR ³ 1 which is equivalent to 2 fold). Two of these probe sets (1438864_at and 1439170_at) refer to unannotated or unclassifiable genes. According to the NetAffx Analysis Center, the third probe set (1447831_s_at) is assigned to myotubularin related protein 7 (Mtmr7). The probe set, however, lies upstream of the Mtmr7 gene (Ensembl gene ENSMUSG00000039431), and its signal is therefore not representative for the Mtmr7 gene. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis with a primer set specific for Mtmr7 confirmed that its expression is not altered in periphilin+/- knockout mice (relative expression compared to wild type: 0.924; p = 0.419).

This has led to the search for compounds that specifically target and inhibit oncogenes as anti-cancer agents. Whether chromosomal instability (CIN) generated as a result of deregulation of the mitotic checkpoint pathway, a frequent characteristic of solid tumors, has any effect on oncogene addiction, however, has not been explored systematically. We show here that induction of chromosome instability by overexpression of the mitotic checkpoint gene Mad2 does not affect the regression of Kras driven lung tumors upon Kras inhibition. However, tumors that experience transient Mad2 overexpression and consequent chromosome instability recur at dramatically elevated rates. The recurrent tumors are highly aneuploid and have varied activation of pro-proliferative pathways. Thus, early CIN may be responsible for tumor relapse after seemingly effective anti-cancer treatments.

With one jak and one stat (stat92E), Drosophila provides a powerful system for finding new JAK/STAT target genes. Genome-wide expression profiling on eye discs in which Stat92E is hyperactivated, revealed 584 differentially-regulated genes, including known targets domeless, socs36E and wingless. Other differentially-regulated genes (chinmo, lama, Mo25, Imp-L2, Serrate, Delta) were validated and may represent new Stat92E targets. Genetic experiments revealed that Stat92E cell-autonomously represses Serrate, which encodes a Notch ligand. Loss of Stat92E led to de-repression of Serrate in the dorsal eye, resulting in ectopic Notch signaling and aberrant eye growth there. Thus, our micro-array documents a new Stat92E target gene and a previously-unidentified inhibitory action of Stat92E on Notch signaling. These data suggest that this study will be a useful resource for the identification of additional Stat92E targets.

"GSE14981"	"Distinct Mechanisms Underlying Tolerance to Intermittent and Constant Hypoxia in Drosophila melanogaster"	"Background: Constant hypoxia (CH) and intermittent hypoxia (IH) occur during several pathological conditions such as asthma and obstructive sleep apnea. Our research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that lead to injury or adaptation to hypoxic stress using Drosophila as a model system. Our current genome-wide study is designed to investigate gene expression changes and identify protective mechanism(s) in D. melanogaster after exposure to severe (1% O2) intermittent or constant hypoxia. Methodology/Principal Findings: Our microarray analysis has identified multiple gene families that are up- or down-regulated in response to acute CH or IH. We observed distinct responses to IH and CH in gene expression that varied in the number of genes and type of gene families. We then studied the role of candidate genes (up-or down-regulated) in hypoxia tolerance (adult survival) for longer periods (CH-7 days, IH-10 days) under severe CH or IH. Heat shock proteins up-regulation (specifically Hsp23 and Hsp70) led to a significant increase in adult survival (as compared to controls) of P-element lines during CH. In contrast, during IH treatment the up-regulation of Mdr49 and l(2)08717 genes (P-element lines) provided survival advantage over controls. This suggests that the increased transcript levels following treatment with either paradigm play an important role in tolerance to severe hypoxia. Furthermore, by over-expressing Hsp70 in specific tissues, we found that up-regulation of Hsp70 in heart and brain play critical role in tolerance to CH in flies. Conclusions/Significance: We observed that the gene expression response to IH or CH is specific and paradigm-dependent. We have identified several genes Hsp23, Hsp70, CG1600, l(2)08717 and Mdr49 that play an important role in hypoxia tolerance whether it is in CH or IH. These data provide further clues about the mechanisms by which IH or CH lead to cell injury and morbidity or adaptation and survival.

Two distinct forms of the major SWI/SNF-related complex that have different activities in vitro can be distinguished by the presence of specific accessory subunits. In Drosophila, the core Brahma complex associates either with Osa to form the BAP complex, or with Bap170 and Bap180 to form the PBAP complex. Mutations affecting the core subunits have stronger developmental phenotypes than osa mutations; these differences could be due to PBAP complex activity . We have generated mutations in the genes encoding the PBAP-specific subunits Bap170 and Bap180 in order to study their functions in vivo. Bap180 is not essential for viability, but is required in ovarian follicle cells for normal eggshell development. Bap170 is necessary to stabilize the Bap180 protein; however, a mutant form that retains this function is sufficient for survival and fertility. The two subunits act redundantly to allow metamorphosis; using gene expression profiling of double mutants, we have found that the PBAP complex regulates genes involved in tissue remodeling and immune system function.

Second, we have performed the temporal gene expression profiling by extracting the MG muscles of the same individual from the both legs at two different times to minimize the inter-individual genetic variability. The MG muscle represent an excellent candidate for biopsy due to its easy accessible by surgery and also because its biopsy is well tolerated by the animals allowing us to perform another later biopsy in the other leg to obtain two MG samples of the same individual at two different times. Moreover, MG muscle is composed of approximately 20-30% type I (red) fibers and 70-80% type II (white) fibers {Ariano MA, 1973}, {Simard C, 1988}, {Zhan WZ, 1992} and therefore is more representative of skeletal muscle tissue in general than a muscle composed exclusively by red or white fibers.<br><br><br><br>The transcript expression profiles in MG muscles from mdx and wild-type mice were analyzed at 3 weeks, 1.5 months and 3 months of life by using the 430 2.0 gene chips from Affymetrix (n=3 for each condition).

However, the other two comparisons were directed to elucidate the genes that are varying throughout the period of time analyzed in every mice strain, and therefore we obtained on the one hand the genes that vary in mdx mice but not in wild-type, and on the other hand the genes that vary in control animals but remain unchanged in mdx mice between the times analyzed. To present the results in a more comprehensive form, all the genes were classified in seven different categories: Cell adhesion & extracellular matrix; Proteolysis; Muscle structure & regeneration; Inflammation & immune response; Cell signaling & cell communication; Metabolism; and Others/unknown. The resulting genes from our study were classified in their functional categories using information from Affymetrix (www.affymetrix.com) and from the Gene Ontology database accessible in the Jackson Laboratory Mouse Genome Informatics website (www.informatics.jax.org).<br><br>"	"ArrayExpress"	"partial"		
"GSE13873"	"Transcription profiling of mouse gastric epithelium"	"Chronic infection with the bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori is a risk factor for the development of gastric cancer, yet remains asymptomatic in a majority of individuals. We report here that the C57Bl6 mouse model of experimental infection with the closely related H. felis recapitulates this wide range in host susceptibility. A majority of infected mice develop premalignant lesions such as gastric atrophy, compensatory epithelial hyperplasia and intestinal metaplasia, whereas a minority is completely protected from preneoplasia. Protection is associated with the failure to mount an IFN-gamma response to the infection and an associated high Helicobacter burden. We demonstrate that IFN-gamma is essential for clearance of Helicobacter, but also mediates the formation of preneoplastic lesions. We further provide evidence that IFN-gamma triggers a specific transcriptional program in murine gastric epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo, and induces their preferential transformation to the hyperplastic phenotype. In summary, our data suggest a dual role for IFN-gamma in Helicobacter pathogenesis that could provide an explanation for the differential susceptibility to H. pylori-induced gastric pathology in the human population. Experiment Overall Design: We chose mice for gene expression profiling that following Helicobacter infection had (a) symptoms of gastritis, but no epithelial changes, (b) atrophic gastritis accompanied by corpus gland hyperplasia or (c) atrophic gastritis accompanied by intestinal metaplasia. An uninfected control group was also included in the analysis, as were two groups of mice that lacked mature T- and B-cells due to a deletion mutation in the rag1 gene (Rag-1-/-) and that were either experimentally infected or served as Rag-1-/- uninfected controls. To see the effects of IFNg on murine gastric epithelial cells we analysed an immortalized murine primary gastric epithelial cell line treated with three different concentrations of IFNg in comparison to an untreated control."

Ngn3 controls endocrine cell fate decisions. Ngn3 deficient mice do not develop any pancreatic endocrine cells, including insulin producing beta cells, and die postnatally from diabetes. Therefore, the characterization of gene expression in Ngn3-expressing cells and their progeny is of particular interest for the development of novel strategies for cell replacement therapies in type-1 diabetes. Here we describe two studies. In the first study (8 assays) we used mice where the EYFP (Enhanced Yellow fluorescent Protein) is expressed under the control of Ngn3 regulatory elements (knock add on strategy). EYFP-positive, Ngn3-expressing cells, were FACS sorted from embryonic pancreas at day 15.5 (E15.5), as well as EYFP-negative cells. In the second study (6 assays) we compared wild-type and Ngn3 mutant pancreas at E15.5. All samples were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430.2.0 array."	"ArrayExpress"	"partial"		
"GSE15349"	"Transcription profiling of mouse skeletal muscle gene expression after myostatin knockout in mature animals"	"RNA from 5 mice with postdevelopmental knockout of myostatin and 5 mice with normal myostatin expression was analyzed with comprehensive oligonucleotide microarrays. Myostatin depletion affected the expression of several hundred genes at nominal P < 0.01, but fewer than a hundred effects were statistically significant according to a more stringent criterion (false discovery rate < 5%). Most of the effects were less than 1.5-fold in magnitude. In contrast to previously-reported effects of constitutive myostatin knockout, postdevelopmental knockout did not downregulate expression of genes encoding slow isoforms of contractile proteins or genes encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism. Several collagen genes were expressed at lower levels in the myostatin-deficient muscles, and this led to reduced tissue collagen levels as reflected by hydroxyproline content. Myostatin knockout tended to down-regulate the expression of sets of genes with promoter motifs for Smad3, Smad4, myogenin, NF- B, serum response factor, and numerous other transcription factors. Main conclusions: in mature muscle, myostatin is a key transcriptional regulator of collagen genes, but not genes encoding contractile proteins or genes encoding proteins involved in energy metabolism.

We were particularly interested in two groups of transcripts. The first group consists of transcripts which expression in the lung is regulated in response to M. tuberculosis infection (global response to infection), and that is obtained by comparing transcripts profiles of infected vs. uninfected lungs. The second group of transcripts is associated with increased resistance to M. tuberculosis infection of B6 and D2.B6-Chr7 mice.

These carcinomas display a hair follicle origin, are aggressive and highly undifferentiated. Using gene expression profiling, we report here that a mouse p53-tumor gene signature allowed validation of p53-deficient models to analyze agressive human cancer, and from which we have developed an accurate genomic predictor of human breast cancer clinical outcome using a new methodology based on interspecies comparison. The results demonstrated that the mouse p53-tumor signature recapitulates molecular features of p53-mutated human cancer samples, undifferentiated and aggressive human tumors from different anatomical locations, and human embryonic stem cells. Combining the mouse p53-signature with Cox regression analysis of human breast cancer microarray samples, we have developed a 40-gene predictor which is independent of current clinical prognostic variables. Overall, gene profiling analyses validates mouse p53-tumor models as promising tools for preclinical tests of targeted therapies against human aggressive tumors. Furthermore, we propose that the gene expression-based method described to develop the predictor could be used to obtain new genomic predictors of clinical outcome of human cancer using other animal models of aggressive tumors.

First, we used laser capture microdissection to perform a genome-wide expression analysis of each of its developing components. The expression patterns of genes identified in this screen were examined in the TMJ and compared to other synovial joints including the shoulder joint and the hip joint. Striking differences were noted, indicating that the TMJ forms via a distinct molecular program. Several components of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway are among the genes identified in the screen, including Gli2, which is expressed specifically in the condyle and in the disk of the developing TMJ. We found that mice deficient in Gli2 display aberrant TMJ development such that the condyle loses its growth plate-like cellular organization and no disk is formed. In addition, we utilized a conditional strategy to remove activity of the Hh co-receptor encoded by Smo from chondrocyte progenitors. This cell autonomous loss of Hh signaling allows for disk formation, but the resulting structure fails to separate from the condyle. Thus, these experiments establish that Hh signaling acts at two distinct steps in disk morphogenesis, condyle initiation and disk-condyle separation, and provide a molecular framework for future studies of the TMJ.

We report here the first application of Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to investigate a knockout (KO) murine model of a human genetic disease. WGCNA identified networks and key hub transcripts from liver mRNA of glycerol kinase (Gyk) KO and wild type (WT) mice. Day of life 1 (dol1) samples from KO mice contained a network module enriched for organic acid metabolism before Gyk KO mice develop organic acidemia and die on dol3-4 and the module containing Gyk was enriched with apoptotic genes. Roles for the highly connected Acot, Psat and Plk3 transcripts were confirmed in cell cultures and subsequently validated by causality testing. We provide evidence that GK may have an apoptotic moonlighting role that is lost in GKD. This systems biology strategy has improved our understanding of GKD pathogenesis and suggests possible treatments.

"GSE14691"	"Transcription profiling of mouse expressing toxic UGexp RNA vs. Mbnl1 knockout and Clcn1 null mice to assess the post-transcriptional impact of toxic RNA in myotonic dystrophy"	"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an RNA dominant disease in which mutant transcripts containing an expanded CUG repeat (CUGexp) cause muscle dysfunction by interfering with biogenesis of other mRNAs. The toxic effects of mutant RNA are mediated partly through sequestration of splicing regulator Muscleblind-like 1 (Mbnl1), a protein that binds to CUGexp RNA. A gene that is prominently affected encodes chloride channel 1 (Clcn1), resulting in hyperexcitability of muscle (myotonia). To identify DM1-affected genes and study mechanisms for dysregulation, we performed global mRNA profiling in transgenic mice that express CUGexp RNA, as compared to Mbnl1 knockout and Clcn1 null mice. We found that the majority of changes induced by CUGexp RNA in skeletal muscle can be explained by reduced activity of Mbnl1, including many changes that are secondary to myotonia. The pathway most affected comprises genes involved in calcium signaling and homeostasis. Some effects of CUGexp RNA on gene expression are caused by abnormal alternative splicing or downregulation of Mbnl1-interacting mRNAs. However, several of the most highly dysregulated genes showed altered transcription, as indicated by parallel changes of the corresponding premRNAs. These results support the idea that trans-dominant effects of CUGexp RNA on gene expression in this transgenic model may occur at the level of transcription, RNA processing, and mRNA decay, and are mediated mainly but not entirely through sequestration of Mbnl1.

"GSE15770"	"Transcription profiling of mouse wild type and Get1 +/- mutant bladder time course"	"Skin and bladder epithelia form effective permeability barriers through the activation of distinct differentiation gene programs. Employing a genome-wide gene expression study, we identified transcription regulators whose expression correlates highly with that of differentiation markers both in bladder and skin, including the Grainyhead factor Get1/Grhl3, already known to be important for epidermal barrier formation. In the bladder, Get1 is most highly expressed in the differentiated umbrella cells and its mutation in mice leads to a defective bladder epithelial barrier formation due to failure of apical membrane specialization. Genes encoding components of the specialized urothelial membrane, the uroplakins, were downregulated in Get1-/- mice. At least one of these genes, Uroplakin II, is a direct target of Get1. The urothelial-specific activation of the Uroplakin II gene is due to selective binding of Get1 to the Uroplakin II promoter in urothelial cells, most likely regulated by histone modifications. These results demonstrate a key role for Get1 in urothelial differentiation and barrier formation. Experiment Overall Design: To gain insights into common and unique transcriptional regulatory programs during bladder differentiation, we profiled global gene expression in whole mouse bladder at E14.5, E16.5, and E18.5."

"GSE11186"	"Transcription profiling of mouse dorsal skin during hair follicle cycling"	"Hair follicles undergo continuous cycling of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen) with a defined periodicity. Evolutionarily conserved hair follicle cycling is thought to provide mechanisms for controlling the length of hair in specific body sites, and to allow the periodic shedding of fur in response to seasonal changes in mammals. The periodicity of the hair growth cycle ranges from approximately three-weeks in synchronized hair follicles of mouse dorsal skin to several years in hair follicles of human scalp where the follicles undergo an extended period of anagen. Although numerous molecular pathways, including BMP signaling, have been implicated in the control of hair follicle cycling, the underlying mechanisms regulating its timing remain elusive. Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that CLOCK-regulated genes are regulated during the hair growth cycle, including prominent expression in the secondary hair germ during telogen and early anagen. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice revealed a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting the circadian clock regulates hair follicle cycling via its effect on the cell cycle. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our data link circadian clock genes to biological oscillation that is weeks in duration. Experiment Overall Design: To investigate the molecular control of hair follicle cycling, we profiled mRNA expression in mouse dorsal skin at multiple representative time points in the synchronized second postnatal hair growth cycle and in a depilation-induced hair growth cycle. For profiling of second synchronized and depilation-induced hair growth cycle, the same upper-mid region of dorsal skin was excised from C57BL/6 mice at representative postnatal days (P). The time points for second hair growth cycle are classified into different phases of the hair growth cycle based on established morphological guidelines as follow: early anagen (P23, P25), mid anagen (P27), late anagen (P29, P34), early catagen (P37, P39), mid catagen (P41), and telogen (P44). Depilation-induced hair growth cycle by applying wax/rosin mixture on the dorsal skin of seven-week old mice (all follicles in telogen) was performed on mice. The corresponding phases of the hair growth cycle at number of days following depilation (D) is as follow: early anagen (D3), mid anagen (D5), late anagen (D8, D12), and early catagen (D17).

"GSE14395"	"Transcription profiling of mouse PPAR-apha knockouts reveals gender-specific gene repression of PPAR-alpha knockouts in liver and heart"	"Most metabolic studies are conducted in male animals; thus, the molecular mechanism controlling gender-specific pathways has been neglected, including sex-dependent responses to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Here we show that PPARalpha has broad female-dependent repressive actions on hepatic genes involved in steroid metabolism and inflammation. In males, this effect is reproduced by the administration of synthetic PPARalpha ligand. Using the steroid hydroxylase gene Cyp7b1 as a model, we elucidated the molecular mechanism of this PPARalpha-dependent repression. Initial sumoylation of the ligand-binding domain of PPARalpha triggers the interaction of PPARalpha with the GA-binding protein alpha bound to the target promoter. Histone deacetylase is then recruited, and histones and adjacent Sp1-binding site are methylated. These events result in the loss of Sp1-stimulated expression, and thus the down-regulation of Cyp7b1. Physiologically, this repression confers protection against estrogen-induced intrahepatic cholestasis, paving the way for a novel therapy against the most common hepatic disease during pregnancy. Experiment Overall Design: Expression profile difference between male and female PPARalpha wild-type and knock-out mice in liver and heart (3 pools of 4 animals in each group).

Alterations of the normal function of these proteins lead to pathological processes such as developmental disorders and neoplastic transformation. We have generated transgenic mice introducing the onco-Dbl cDNA sequences linked to the metallothionein promoter into the germ line of FVB mice and found that onco-Dbl expression affected proliferation, migration and differentiation of lens epithelial cells. We used high density oligonucleotide microarray to define the transcriptional profile induced by Dbl in the lenses of transgenic mice and observed modulation of genes encoding proteins promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, genes encoding proteins involved in the positive regulation of apoptosis were markedly down regulated while anti-apoptotic genes were strongly up-regulated. Finally, several genes encoding proteins involved in the process of angiogenesis were up-regulated. These observations were validated by histological and immunohistochemical examination of the transgenic lenses, where vascularization can be readily observed. Thus, onco-Dbl expression in mouse lenses induces disruption of the lens architecture, epithelial cell proliferation, EMT, evasion from cell death, and aberrant angiogenesis.

As a result, GAP-43 KO mice fail to form barrels in mouse somatosensory cortex (S1) (Maier et al., 1999). GAP-43 heterozygous (HZ) mice show abnormalities in axonal pathfinding and show larger than normal barrels in layer IV S1 due to widely branched thalamocortical afferents (TCAs). Regardless of abnormalities during early development, HZ barrels become indistinguishable from WT by postnatal day 26. One explanation for these findings is that compensatory mechanisms may be activated in GAP-43 HZ cortex. We have used mRNA microarray expression analysis to gain a more comprehensive view of genes involved in GAP-43 signaling during barrel map formation. Using laser microdissection , cortical cells of the barrel cortex were excised, RNA extracted and used in GeneChip analysis. Expression profiling and functional gene group analysis of RNA from WT, HZ, and KO cortex at postnatal day 5 was performed. We identified thousands of transcripts differentially expressed across the genotypes. Verification of selected changes in gene expression was accomplished using in situ hybridization. Our results suggest an adaptive modification in transcript expression of genes involved in cell-cell communication and synaptogenesis. These modifications appear important in forward and reverse signaling as well as maintaining synchrony between the cells. Compensatory up- and down regulation of synapse-associated genes may explain the reverse in HZ phenotype from P7 to P26. Moreover, these findings provide new insight into the role GAP-43 plays in several pathways associated with synaptogenesis and trans-synaptic signaling. Experiment Overall Design: 3 replicate RNA samples were prepared from laser microdissected barrel cortex samples of WT, HZ and KO mice at a single timepoint (postnatal day 5)"	"GEO"	"partial"

"GSE9400"	"Transcription profiling of mouse quadriceps muscle after exposure to chronic, normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic environments for 2 weeks"	"To address whether hypoxia contributes to muscle patho-physiology, normal, adult C57 mice were exposed to chronic, normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic environments for 2 weeks in order to simulate levels of hypoxaemia reported in DMD patients with advanced respiratory insufficiency. Control mice were maintained under normoxic conditions. Control and experimental mice were studied. Experiment Overall Design: Adult male C57Bl/10 mice were used in experiments. At the beginning of the experiment mice were divided into two groups, control (room condition) and hypoxic (hypoxic condition), over a period of 2 weeks. The hypoxic group was gradually exposed to lower levels of hypoxia in an especially designed and hermetically closed hypoxic chamber. A Pegas 4000 MF(Columbus Instruments) gas blending system was used. The oxygen level was gradually decreased from 21% to 8% over one week and animals were kept at 8% oxygen for another 7 days. Animal s weights were monitored daily. Food and water were changed daily for the time of the experiment. After two weeks animals were euthanized using CO2, Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and Soleus muscles were dissected for physiological studies. Prior to physiological analysis each group was divided into two smaller groups (subgroups). In the first subgroup the primary focus on physiological muscle analysis was on (EDL) while in the other subgroup it was on Soleus. This division allowed us that both muscles, EDL and Soleus were analyzed at the same time after euthanization. Experiment Overall Design: RNA isolation Experiment Overall Design: Total RNA was isolated from each QF muscle by Tri-Reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX) as described by manufacturer. Isolated total RNA were cleaned up by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described by manufacturer. The purity and concentration of total RNA were determined by measurement of absorbance at 260 and 280nm using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). To satisfy our purity criteria, we discarded all RNA samples that did not have a 260/280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.1. To satisfy our criteria for integrity, we required that all RNA used in our experiments have single peaks for the 18S and 28S bands as determined by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Experiment Overall Design: Linear amplification and cRNA labeling Experiment Overall Design: Three microliter total RNA was used for each sample to obtain linearly amplified labeled cRNA by using GeneChip One-Cycle Target Labeling kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) as manufacturer described. Briefly; total RNA was used to generate double-stranded cDNA with the T7-oligo (dT) primer. This double-stranded cDNA was used in vitro transcription and biotin labeling steps. Labeled cRNA yield and purity were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280nm. All the cRNA 260/280 ratios were between 1.9 and 2.1. Quality control (QC) of the labeled cRNA products was assessed by performing 1 g labeled cRNA on 2% agarose gel to see similar RNA smear type. Experiment Overall Design: Fragmentation and microarray hybridization Experiment Overall Design: Fifteen micrograms labeled cRNA of hypoxic or normoxic QF muscle was fragmented, and 10 g was hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse 430 ver 2.0 GeneChip arrays for 18 24h (Affymetrix Inc.). Each microarray was washed and stained with streptavidin phycoerythrin and scanned at a 6- m resolution with Agilent model G2500A GeneArray scanner A visual quality control measurement was performed to ensure proper hybridization after each chip was scanned."

The central thesis is straightforward. The combination of microdissected tissues and FACS sorted cells plus microarray analysis offers a powerful, efficient and effective method for the creation of a global gene expression atlas of the developing urogenital system. Microarrays with essentially complete genome coverage can be used to quantitate expression levels of every gene. The ensuing rapid read-out provides an expression atlas that is more sensitive, more economical and more complete than would be possible by in situ hybridizations alone. The data submitted here delineates the gene expression profiles of the e15 mouse ureter. Comparisons with the same compartments in the neonate will be made to determine changes in gene expression from relatively undifferentiated tissue (e15) to a highly differentiated structure (neonate). Experiment Overall Design: FVB/N mice were time mated. At embryonic day 15 mice were euthanized by decapitation and the ureters were microdissected, cut from pelvis to the bladder insertion point and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.

"GSE13402"	"Transcription profiling of mouse SPARC-null vs. wild-type lens epithelium"	"SPARC is a matricellular glycoprotein involved in regulation of the extracellular matrix, growth factors, adhesion, and migration. SPARC-null mice have altered basement membranes and develop posterior sub-capsular cataracts with cell swelling and equatorial vacuoles. Exchange of fluid, nutrients, and waste products in the avascular lens is driven by a unique circulating ion current. Here we demonstrate that SPARC-null mouse lenses exhibit abnormal circulation of fluid, ion, and small molecules which leads to altered fluorescein distribution in vivo, loss of resting membrane polarization, and altered distribution of small molecules. Microarray analysis of SPARC-null lenses showed changes in gene expression of ion channels and receptors, matrix and adhesion genes, cytoskeleton, immune response genes, and cell signaling molecules. Our results demonstrate that the regulation of SPARC on cell-capsular matrix interactions can influence the circulation of fluid and ions in the lens, and the phenotype in the SPARC-null mouse lens is the result of multiple intersecting pathways. Experiment Overall Design: Lens epithelial cells from 7 lenses of littermate mice were isolated by laser capture microdissection. 3 wild-type lenses from 3 different mice and 4 knock-out lenses from 3 different mice were used as biological replicates."

"GSE15153"	"Transcription profiling of mouse Dll3 mutant vs. wild-type 9.5 dpc somite-level tissue"	"Delta-like 3 (Dll3) is a divergent ligand and modulator of the Notch signaling pathway only identified so far in mammals. Null mutations of Dll3 disrupt cycling expression of Notch targets Hes1, Hes5, and Lfng, but not of Hes7. Compared with Dll1 or Notch1, the effects of Dll3 mutations are less severe for gene expression in the presomitic mesoderm, yet severe segmentation phenotypes and vertebral defects result in both human and mouse. Reasoning that Dll3 specifically disrupts key regulators of somite cycling, we carried out functional analysis to identify targets accounting for the segmental phenotype. Using microdissected embryonic tissue from somitic and presomitic mesodermal tissue, we identified new genes enriched in these tissues, including Limch1, Rphn2, and A130022J15Rik. Surprisingly, we only identified a small number of genes disrupted by the Dll3 mutation. These include Uncx, a somite gene required for rib and vertebral patterning, and Nrarp, a; regulator of Notch/Wnt signaling in zebrafish and a cycling gene in mouse. To determine the effects of Dll3 mutation on Nrarp, we characterized the cycling expression of this gene from early (8.5 dpc) to late (10.5 dpc) somitogenesis. Nrarp displays a distinct pattern of cycling phases when compared to Lfng and Axin2 (a Wnt pathway gene) at 9.5 dpc but appears to be in phase with Lfng by 10.5 dpc. Nrarp cycling appears to require Dll3 but not Lfng modulation. In Dll3 null embryos, Nrarp displayed static patterns. However, in Lfng null embryos, Nrarp appeared static at 8.5 dpc but resumed cycling expression by 9.5 and dynamic expression at 10.5 dpc stages. By contrast, in Wnt3a null embryos, Nrarp expression was completely absent in the presomitic mesoderm. Towards identifying the role of Dll3 in regulating somitogenesis, Nrarp emerges as a potentially important regulator that requires Dll3 but not Lfng for normal function. Experiment Overall Design: To enrich for genes in the somite level tissues that are specifically disrupted by Dll3 mutation, we compared microdissected tissues from wild-type and Dll3 mutant embryos. We generated biological replicate pools from Dll3+/+ (wild-type) or Dll3neo/neo embryos for a total of six pools. Microarray analysis using Affymetrix MOE430A arrays was carried out on the biological pool triplicates for both wild-type and mutant genotypes."	"GEO"	"partial"

To test the hypothesis that beta1-Arg389 and beta1-Gly389 alleles could differentially couple to pathways beyond that of classic Gs-adenylyl cyclase (AC)/cAMP signaling, we performed comparative gene expression profile analyses on hearts from wildtype and transgenic mice that expressed either human beta1-Arg389 and beta1-Gly389 receptors, or AC5 adenyl cyclase, sampling at an early age and stage, prior to the onset of pathologic features. We observed substantial overlap of dysregulated genes across all three transgenic heart models, consistent with a shared coupling to cAMP-dependent regulation of cardiac processes and adaptive responses. All three models up-regulated genes associated with RNA metabolism and translation, and down-regulated genes associated with mitochondria and energy metabolism, consistent with cAMP-driven increase in cardiac contractility, protein synthesis, and compensatory down-regulation of mitochondrial energy production. Both beta1AR transgenics activated additional genes associated with kinase-dependent pathways, and uniquely, beta1-Arg389 hearts caused up-regulation of genes associated with inflammation, programmed cell death, and extracellular matrix. These results substantially expand the scope of 7-transmembrane domain receptor signaling propagation beyond known cognate G-protein couplings. Moreover, they implicate alterations of a repertoire of processes evoked by a single amino acid variation in the cardiac beta1AR that might be exploited for genotype-specific heart failure diagnostics and therapeutics. Experiment Overall Design: RNA was isolated from hearts obtained from non-transgenic mice, AC5 transgenic mice, beta1-Gly389 transgenic mice and beta1-Arg389 transgenic mice at 90 days of age. 6 biological replicates were used for each genotype."

Because PFOS and PFOA have been shown to differ in their mode of action in the murine neonate, these data suggest that changes related to PFOS-induced neonatal toxicity may not be evident in the fetal transcriptome at term. Experiment Overall Design: Thirty timed-pregnant CD-1 mice were orally dosed from gestation day 1-17 with either 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day PFOS in 0.5% Tween 20.

Genes that reside in the PAR1 are exceptional in that they are rich in repetitive sequences and undergo a very high rate of recombination. Remarkably, murine PAR1 homologs have translocated to various autosomes, reflecting the complex recombination history during the evolution of the mammalian X chromosome. We now report that the SNF2-type chromatin remodeling protein ATRX controls the expression of eutherians ancestral PAR1 genes that have translocated to autosomes in the mouse. In addition, we have identified two potentially novel mouse PAR1 orthologs. We propose that the ancestral PAR1 genes share a common epigenetic environment that allows ATRX to control their expression.

However, constitutive expression of KrasG12D in granulosa cells disrupted normal follicle development leading to the persistence of abnormal follicle-like structures containing non-mitotic cells. To determine what factors mediate this potent effect of KrasG12D, gene profiling analyses were done. We also analyzed KrasG12D;Cyp19-Cre and KrasG12D;Pgr-Cre mutant mouse models that express Cre prior to or after the initiation of granulosa cell differentiation, respectively. KrasG12D induced cell cycle arrest in granulosa cells of the KrasG12D;Cyp19-Cre mice but not in the KrasG12D;Pgr-Cre mice, documenting the cell context specific effect of KrasG12D. Expression of KrasG12D silenced the Kras gene, reduced cell cycle activator genes and impaired expression of granulosa cell and oocyte specific genes. Conversely, levels of PTEN and phosphorylated p38MAPK increased markedly in the mutant granulosa cells. Because disrupting Pten in granulosa cells leads to increased proliferation and survival, Pten was disrupted in the KrasG12D mutant mice. The Pten/Kras mutant mice were infertile but lacked GCTs. By contrast, the Ptenfl/fl;KrasG12D;Amhr2-Cre mice developed aggressive ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cell tumors that did not occur in the Ptenfl/fl;KrasG12D;Cyp19-Cre or Ptenfl/fl;KrasG12D;Pgr-Cre mouse strains. These data document unequivocally that Amhr2-Cre is expressed in and mediates allelic recombination of oncogenic genes in OSE cells. That KrasG12D/Pten mutant granulosa cells do not transform but rather undergo cell cycle arrest indicates that they resist the oncogenic insults of Kras/Pten by robust self-protecting mechanisms that silence the Kras gene and elevate PTEN and phospho-p38MAPK.

In order to understand PTHrP s effects on mesenchymal cells, we profiled gene expression in WT and PTHrP-/- mammary buds, and in WT and K14-PTHrP ventral skin, at E15.5. By cross-referencing the differences in gene expression between these groups, we identified 35 genes potentially regulated by PTHrP in the mammary mesenchyme, including 6 genes known to be involved in BMP signaling. One of these genes was MMP2. We demonstrated that PTHrP and BMP4 regulate MMP2 gene expression and MMP2 activity in mesenchymal cells.

"GSE10169"	"Transcription profiling of Drosophila model of mitochondrial disease"	"Background: A point mutation in the Drosophila gene technical knockout (tko), encoding mitoribosomal protein S12, provokes a phenotype of respiratory chain deficiency, developmental delay and neurological abnormalities similar to those presented in many human mitochondrial disorders, as well as defective courtship behaviour. Results: Transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression in tko25t mutant flies revealed systematic, compensatory changes in expression of genes connected with metabolism, including upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase and of many genes involved in the catabolism of fats and proteins, the TCA cycle and anaplerotic pathways feeding into it. Gut-specific enzymes involved in the primary mobilization of dietary fat and protein, as well as a number of transport functions, were strongly upregulated, consistent with the idea that OXPHOS dysfunction is perceived physiologically as a starvation for particular biomolecules. Many stress-response genes were also induced. Other changes may reflect a signature of developmental delay. There was also down-regulation of genes connected with reproduction, including gametogenesis, especially in females, and courtship behaviour in males. This might represent a programmed response to a mitochondrially generated starvation signal. Although human sexual behaviour is not known to respond to mitochondrial dysfunction, the underlying signaling pathway, if conserved, could influence many physiological processes in response to nutritional stress. Transcriptomic analysis suggested the possible involvement of the Akt1/sgg signaling pathway(s). Conclusions: The transformation of metabolism in response to mitochondrial dysfunction, including digestive and absorptive functions, gives important clues as to how novel therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial disorders might be developed. Experiment Overall Design: Crosses and maintenance: Inbreeding under stressful conditions inevitably results in the selection of compensatory alleles of many genes. In order to avoid such issues, and thus determine the global effects on gene expression of the tko25t mutation in a truly unselected and 'wild-type' background, we outbred tko25t over more than 10 generations by back-crossing to each of two commonly used wild-type strains, Canton S and Oregon R. Subsequent to this backcrossing, tko25t was maintained in each background using a balancer chromosome. These stocks were then used to generate a tko25t mutant F1 generation, by crossing virgin Canton S tko25t homozygous mutant females with Oregon R tko25t males. For comparison, we generated otherwise isogenic wild-type F1 progeny by crossing virgin Canton S wild-type females with Oregon R wild-type males. Experiment Overall Design: Samples: Both tko25t and wild-type Drosophila adult flies of both sexes were collected and aged to 1 day old prior to RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays. We extracted RNA from 3 independent such crosses. Experiment Overall Design: Comparative analysis: Data analysis for each gene in the array compared each tko25t mutant RNA isolate with each wild-type RNA isolate from flies of the given sex, generating 9 comparative measurements, over which the statistical analysis was performed."

The full repertoire of cyclin D1 functions in normal development and in cancer cells is currently unknown. To address this question, here we introduce a novel approach that allows one to determine the set of cyclin D1-interacting proteins (D1 interactome ) and cyclin D1-bound genomic fragments (D1 cistrome ) in essentially any mouse organ, at any point of development or at any stage of cancer progression. Using this approach, we detected several novel tissue-specific interactors of cyclin D1. A significant number of these partners represent proteins involved in transcription. We show, using genome-wide location analysis3, that cyclin D1 occupies promoters of a very large number of genes in the developing mouse, where it binds in close proximity to transcription start sites. Bioinformatics analyses of cyclin D1-bound genomic segments in the developing embryo revealed DNA recognition sequences for several transcription factors. By querying SAGE libraries4, promoter CpG content5 and gene expression profiles of cyclin D1-null organs, we demonstrate that cyclin D1 binds promoters of highly expressed genes, and that it functions to activate or to repress gene expression in vivo. Analyses of cyclin D1 transcriptional targets reveal that cyclin D1 contributes to cell proliferation by upregulating genes required for S-phase entry and progression. Hence, cyclin D1 plays a broad transcriptional regulatory function in vivo during normal mouse development. We wished to determine whether cyclin D1 functioned to positively or negatively regulate transcription of the target genes (identified by chip-on-chip) in vivo. To address this question, we asked how expression of cyclin D1-bound genes changes when cyclin D1 has been knocked-out. We dissected retinas from eyes of cyclin D1-/- or wild-type neonates, isolated RNA and hybridized it onto Affymetrix expression arrays."	"GEO"	"partial"

However, the mechanism by which CBFB-MYH11 initiates leukemogenesis is not clear. Previously published reports showed that CBFB-MYH11 dominantly inhibits RUNX1 and CBFB, and such inhibition has been suggested as the mechanism for leukemogenesis. However, knockin mice expressing Cbfb-MYH11 (Cbfb+/MYH11) showed defects in primitive hematopoiesis not seen in Cbfb null (Cbfb-/-) embryos indicating that Cbfb-MYH11 has repression independent activities as well. To identify gene expression changes associated with this novel activity, we compared the gene expression profile in the blood cells of Cbfb+/MYH11 and Cbfb-/- embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) embryos with that of their wildtype littermates. Cbfb-MYH11 chimeras were mated to C57/Bl6 females to generate Cbfb+/MYH11 (Cbfb+/MYH11) and Cbfb+/+ (WT) embryos. Cbfb+/- x Cbfb+/- matings were used to generate Cbfb+/+ (Cbfb+/+) and Cbfb-/- (Cbfb-/-) embryos. Blood from 8-10 E12.5 embryos of the same genotype was pooled, and RNA was isolated, labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix Genechip mouse microarray (430 2.0) chips. 4 chips were used for both the Cbfb+/MYH11 and littermate control samples. 3 chips were used for the Cbfb-/- samples and littermate control samples."

"GSE16083"	"Accelerated Postnatal Growth Increases Lipogenic Gene Expression and Adipocyte Size in Low-Birth Weight Mice"	"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the hormonal milieu and adipose gene expression in response to catch-up growth (CUG), a growth pattern associated with obesity and diabetes risk, in a mouse model of low birth weight (LBW). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: ICR mice were food restricted by 50% from gestational days 12.5-18.5, reducing offspring birth weight by 25%. During the suckling period, dams were either fed ad libitum, permitting CUG in offspring, or food restricted, preventing CUG. Offspring were killed at age 3 weeks, and gonadal fat was removed for RNA extraction, array analysis, RT-PCR, and evaluation of cell size and number. Serum insulin, thyroxine (T4), corticosterone, and adipokines were measured. RESULTS: At age 3 weeks, LBW mice with CUG (designated U-C) had body weight comparable with controls (designated C-C); weight was reduced by 49% in LBW mice without CUG (designated U-U). Adiposity was altered by postnatal nutrition, with gonadal fat increased by 50% in U-C and decreased by 58% in U-U mice (P < 0.05 vs. C-C mice). Adipose expression of the lipogenic genes Fasn, AccI, Lpin1, and Srebf1 was significantly increased in U-C compared with both C-C and U-U mice (P < 0.05). Mitochondrial DNA copy number was reduced by >50% in U-C versus U-U mice (P = 0.014). Although cell numbers did not differ, mean adipocyte diameter was increased in U-C and reduced in U-U mice (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CUG results in increased adipose tissue lipogenic gene expression and adipocyte diameter but not increased cellularity, suggesting that catch-up fat is primarily associated with lipogenesis rather than adipogenesis in this murine model. Epididymal fat samples were obtained at age 3 weeks from 5 control mice (CC), 5 mice exposed to in utero undernutrition (UC), and 4 mice exposed to undernutrition in utero and during suckling (UU)."

"GSE19954"	"Transcription profiling of mouse reveals telmisartan improves insulin resistance with modulating adipose tissue macrophage polarization in high fat-fed animals"	"Diet-induced obesity is reported to induce a phenotypic switch in adipose tissue macrophages from an antiinflammatory M2 state to a proinflammatory M1 state. Telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist and a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, reportedly has beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity. We studied the effects of telmisartan on the adipose tissue macrophage phenotype in high fat-fed mice. Telmisartan was administered for 5 weeks to high fat-fed C57BL/6 mice. Insulin sensitivity, macrophage infiltration, and the gene expressions of M1 and M2 markers in epididymal fat tissues were examined. Insulin- or a glucose-tolerance test showed that telmisartan treatment improved insulin resistance, decreasing the body weight gain, visceral fat weight and adipocyte size without affecting the amount of food intake. Telmisartan treatment reduced the number of CD11c-positive cells and crown-like structures. Telmisartan reduced the mRNA expressions of M1 macrophage markers, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, and increased the expression of M2 markers, such as IL-10 and Mgl2. The reduction of M1 macrophage markers, as well as the increased gene expression of M2 markers especially IL-10, is a possible mechanism for the improvement of insulin sensitivity by telmisartan. Experiment Overall Design: Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from CLEA Japan. The mice were fed a chow that contained 10% of its calories from fat (control) or a high-fat diet (HFD) that contained 30% of its calories from fat for 24 weeks. The high fat-fed mice were randomized to 3 groups. Either telmisartan (~3 mg/kg/day) in drinking water (HFD+Tel), candesartan (~3 mg/kg/day) in drinking water (HFD+Can), or a HFD without any drugs (HFD) was administered for the next 5 weeks. Two mice were treated per group. Epididymal adipose tissues were rapidly removed from each mouse. Gene expression in epididymal fat tissue was analyzed using a GeneChip system with the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array, which was spotted with 45,101 probe sets (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Sample preparation for the array hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer s instructions. In short, 5 g of total RNA was used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA using the GeneChip Expression 3 -Amplification Reagents One-Cycle cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix). Biotin-labeled cRNA was then synthesized from the cDNA using GeneChip Expression 3 -Amplification Reagents for IVT Labeling (Affymetrix). After fragmentation, the biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to arrays at 45 C for 16 h. The arrays were washed, stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin, and scanned using a probe array scanner. The scanned chip was analyzed using the GeneChip Analysis Suite software (Affymetrix).

"GSE14242"	"Transcription profiling of mouse WT and Hyp mice at 12 days of age reveals novel regulators of Fgf23 expression and mineralization in Hyp Bone"	"We used gene array analysis of cortical bone to identify Phex-dependent gene transcripts regulating Fgf23 production and mineralization in Hyp mice. We discovered that activation of Fgf receptor- and Wnt-pathways contribute to increased Ffg23 gene transcription in Hyp bone. We found evidence in Hyp bone for increased expression of Fgf1, Fgf7, and Egr2 in the Fgf-signaling pathway and decrements in Sost and Cpz and increments in Sfrp1 and 4 in the Wnt-signaling pathway. Moreover, activation of Fgf and Wnt-signaling stimulated, whereas Tgf inhibited Fgf23 promoter activity in osteoblasts. We also observed reductions in Bmp1, a metalloproteinase that metabolizes the Fgf23 regulatory extracellular matrix protein Dmp1. These findings suggest that elevation of Fgf23 expression in osteocytes is regulated by interactions between cell surface expression of Phex, extracellular matrix proteins and paracrine effects of Fgf and Wnt. Alterations were also found in enzymes regulating the posttranslational processing and stability of Fgf23, including decrements in the glycosyltransferase Galnt3 and the proprotein convertase Pcsk5. In addition, we found that the Pcsk5 and the glycosyltransferase Galnt3 were decreased in Hyp bone, suggesting that reduced post-translational processing of FGF23 may also contribute to increased Fgf23 levels in Hyp mice. With regards to mineralization, we identified additional candidates to explain the intrinsic mineralization defect in Hyp osteoblasts, including increases in the mineralization inhibitors Mgp and Thbs4, as well as increases in local pH altering factors, carbonic anhydrase 12 (Car12) and 3 (Car3) and the sodium-dependent citrate transporter (Slc13a5). These studies demonstrate the complexity of gene expression alterations in bone that accompanies inactivating Phex mutations and identify novel pathways that may coordinate Fgf23 expression and mineralization of extracellular matrix in Hyp bone. Experiment Overall Design: We isolated total RNAs from long bones of both WT and Hyp mice at 12 days of age. Since the RNA yields from the long bones are very low, we combined 2 bone samples with same genotype (WT or Hyp) for one RNA extraction. We will compare the difference of the gene expressions between Hyp and WT. We will use 4 samples in each animal condition."	"GEO"	"partial"		
"GSE20160"	"Gene Expression Data from Prefrontal Cortex and Nucleus Accumbens from Inbred Strains of Mice"	"Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is an ubiquitously expressed enzyme that maintains basic biologic functions by inactivating catechol substrates. In humans, polymorphic variance at the COMT locus has been associated with modulation of pain sensitivity (Andersen & Skorpen, 2009) and risk for developing psychiatric disorders (Harrison & Tunbridge, 2008). A functional haplotype associated with increased pain sensitivity was shown to result in decreased COMT activity by altering mRNA secondary structure-dependent protein translation (Nackley et al., 2006). However, the exact mechanisms whereby COMT modulates pain sensitivity and behavior remain unclear and can be further studied in animal models. We have pursued a genome-wide approach to examining gene expression in multiple brain regions in inbred strains of mice and have discovered that Comt1 is differentially expressed. This expression difference was validated with qPCR. A B2-B4 Short Interspersed Element (SINE) was inserted in the 3'UTR of Comt1 in 14 strains that also shared a common haplotype. Experiments using mammalian expression vectors of full-length cDNA clones with and without the SINE element demonstrate that strains with the SINE haplotype (+SINE) have greater Comt1 enzymatic activity. +SINE mice also exhibit behavioral differences in anxiety assays and decreased pain sensitivity. These results suggest that a haplotype, defined by a 3'UTR B2-B4 SINE element, regulates Comt1 expression and mouse behavior. Brain region samples were isolated from male and female mice of 29 strains (n = 3), 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, AKR/J, BALB/cByJ, BTBR T+ tf/J, BUB/BnJ , C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, C57BR/cdJ, C58/J, CBA/J, CE/J, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, I/LnJ, KK/HIJ, MA/MyJ, MRL/MpJ, NOD/LtJ, NON/LtJ, NZO/HILTJ, NZW/LacJ, P/J, PL/J, RIIIS/J, SJL/J, SM/J, SWR/J, and WSB/EiJ. Eight to ten week old male and female mice of each strain were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The mice were habituated for one week prior to tissue collection. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation without anesthesia to avoid gene expression differences in response to anesthetic. All dissections were conducted between the hours of 9:00AM to 11:30AM. Prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens were dissected as follows. Immediately following euthanasia, mice were decapitated and the whole brain was removed from the skull. The brain was then transferred, ventral side up, to an ice-cold brain matrix with 0.5mm spacing (505C Braintree Scientific). A single razor blade was placed into the first space on the brain matrix and the rostral surface of the brain was placed in the matrix and touching this blade. Thin, double-edged razor blades were placed in the twelve most anterior spaces. Following removal from the matrix, the 0.5 mm brain slices were placed flat onto an ice-cold dissection stage and specific regions dissected using anatomical landmarks as described below. The prefrontal cortex was taken from the slice corresponding to approximately 2.5 mm to 2.0 mm anterior to Bregma. To do so, a V-shaped wedge was made just medial to the corpus callosum with the apex terminating at about the lateral ventricle (viewed from the caudal side of the slice). Nucleus accumbens was taken from the adjacent slice approximately 2.0mm to 1.5mm anterior to Bregma. To isolate nucleus accumbens, 1mm punches were taken just ventromedial to the anterior commissure.

We have studied mice with an inactive S1P lyase gene and have found that, in addition to the expected increase of sphingoid base phosphates, other sphingolipids (including sphingosine, ceramide, and sphingomyelin) were substantially elevated in the serum and /or liver of these mice. This latter increase is consistent with a reutilization of the sphingosine backbone for sphingolipid synthesis due to its inability to exit the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Furthermore, the S1P lyase deficiency resulted in changes in the levels of serum and liver lipids not directly within the sphingolipid pathway, including phospholipids, triacyglycerol, diacylglycerol, and cholesterol. Even though lipids in serum and lipid storage were elevated in liver, adiposity was reduced in the S1P lyase-deficient mice. Microarray analysis of lipid metabolism genes in liver showed that the S1P lyase deficiency caused widespread changes in their expression pattern. These results demonstrate that S1P lyase is a key regulator of the levels of multiple sphingolipid substrates and reveal functional links between the sphingolipid metabolic pathway and other lipid metabolic pathways that may be mediated by shared lipid substrates and changes in gene expression programs. The disturbance of lipid homeostasis by altered sphingolipid levels may be relevant to metabolic diseases.

The timing of the onset of this lens opacity is affected by the genetic background, i.e. the mouse strain. To elucidate the mechanism by which cataracts form in the 129Sv/Jae strain earlier than in the C57BL/6J strain, global gene expression was quantitated in the lenses of these strains. Lens cDNAs were analyzed by hybridization to DNA microarrays and with real time-PCR. Theories are proposed based on the observed higher level of expression of the stress-response genes in the C57BL/6J strain and variations in the expression levels of genes involved in protein synthesis, metabolism, catabolism and cell proliferation. How these variations in gene expression might affect the response of lens fiber cells to the increased calcium, caused by lack of alpha3Cx46, is considered. The possibility that the proteins coded by the strain-variable genes might influence the cataract-associated proteolysis of gamma-crystallin is also addressed.

A limited number of studies, primarily in the smoker/oral cancer literature, address this tissue's efficacy for quantitative PCR or microarray gene expression analysis. In this study both qPCR and microarray analyses were used to evaluate gene expression in buccal cells. An initial study comparing blood and buccal cells from the same individuals looked at relative amounts of four genes. The RNA isolated from buccal cells was degraded but was of sufficient quality to be used with RT-qPCR to detect expression of specific genes. Second, buccal cell RNA was used for microarray-based differential gene expression studies by comparing gene expression between smokers and nonsmokers. The isolation and amplification protocol allowed use of 150-fold less buccal cell RNA than had been reported previously with human microarrays. We report here the finding of a small number of significant gene expression differences between smokers and nonsmokers, using buccal cells as target material. Additionally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis confirmed that these genes were changing expression in the same pattern as seen in an earlier buccal cell study performed by another group. Our results suggest that in spite of a high degree of RNA degradation, buccal cells from cheek mucosa could be used to detect differential gene expression between smokers and nonsmokers. However the RNA degradation, increase in sample variability and microarray failure rate show that buccal samples should be used with caution as source material in expression studies. Samples were collected from eight subjects, four smokers (Sm)and four nonsmokers (NS). Each cheek was sampled creating an a and b sample for each subject which is reflected in the array name. All samples were isolated separately for total RNA. Each was hybridzed to microarrays to examine for differential gene expression between smokers and nonsmokers.

It has been suggested to have many biological activities such as anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, chemopreventive, and anti-neurodegenerative properties. We evaluated the impact of curcumin on lifespan, fecundity, feeding rate, oxidative stress, locomotion and gene expression in two different wild type Drosophila melanogaster strains, Canton-S and Ives, under two different experimental conditions. We report that curcumin extended the lifespan of two different strains of Drosophila and was accompanied by protection against oxidative stress, improvement in locomotion and chemopreventive effects. Curcumin also modulated the expression of several aging related genes (genes with age-dependent changes in gene expression) such as mth, thor, InR, and JNK. In order to evaluate the impact of curcumin and aging on gene expression, we first determined which genes were affected by aging alone in Canton S flies. Age-related changes in gene expression were defined as changes in expression levels that occurred between 3 and 40 days of age (median lifespan). Among the 18,880 probe sets in the Affymetrix GeneChip Drosophila Genome 2.0 Array, 1,383 genes (Data on file, 7.3%, P < 0.05) had statistically significant changes in expression levels during this time frame. We next determined the effect of curcumin on gene expression levels in young and aged Canton S flies. Gene expression were defined as changes in expression levels that occurred between 3 and 40 days of aged flies with or without curcumin-feeding."	"GEO"	"partial"

Methods: We analyzed gene expression in 73 NlEpi samples microdissected from frozen tissue. In 42 cases, we used Affymetrix HU133A microarrays to compare gene expression in 18 RM vs 18 age-matched HN (9 ER+, 9 ER-) and 6 PM. Data were validated with qPCR in 31 independent NlEpi samples (8 RM, 17 HN, 6 PM). Results: 98 probesets (86 genes) were differentially expressed between RM and HN samples. Perfoming supervised hierarchical analysis with these 98 probesets, PM and HN samples clustered together, away from RM samples. qPCR validation of independent samples was high (84%) and uniform in RM vs HN, and lower (58%), but more heterogeneous, in RM vs PM. The 86 genes were implicated in many processes including transcription and the MAPK pathway. Conclusion: Gene expression differs between NlEpi of cancer cases and controls. The cancer cases' profile can be discerned in high-risk NlEpi. This suggests that the profile is not an effect of the tumor, but may mark increased risk and reveal breast cancer's earliest genomic changes. We determined that 98 probesets significantly differed between reduction mammoplasty and histologically normal epithelium from breast cancer patients. We also found that the histologically normal epithelium from prophylactic mastectomy patients' gene expression was more similar to histologically normal epithelium from breast cancer patients' than to reduction mammoplasty patients' gene expression. These results demonstrate that gene expression differs between NlEpi of cancer cases and controls. The cancer cases profile can be discerned in high-risk NlEpi. This suggests that the profile is not an effect of the tumor, but may mark increased risk and reveal breast cancer's earliest genomic changes. 42 total laser capture microdissected histologically normal breast tissue samples were analyzed with Affymetrix HU133A microarrays. 36 samples were age-matched between reduction mammoplasty (n=18) and histologically normal epithelial samples from breast cancer patients (n=18; 9ER+, 9ER-). 6 histologically normal epithelial samples from prophylactic mastectomy patients were then compared to data generated from the original 36 sample comparison.

However, little is known on individual transcriptome changes during VAD-support and its relationship to non-failing hearts (NF). In addition no data are available for the transcriptome regulation during non-pulsatile VAD-support. Therefore we analysed the gene-expression patterns of 30 paired samples from VAD-supported (including 8 non-pulsatile VADs) and 8 non-failing control hearts (NF) using the first total human genome-array available. Transmural myocardial samples were collected for RNA-isolation. RNA was isolated by commercial methods and processed according to chip-manufacturer recommendations. cRNA were hybridized on Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, providing coverage of the whole human genome Array. Data was analyzed using Microarray Analysis Suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) and clustered by Expressionist software (Genedata). 352 transcripts were differentially regulated between samples from VAD-implantation and NF, whereas 510 were significantly regulated between VAD-transplantation and NF (paired t-test p<0.001, fold change >=1.6). Remarkably, only a minor fraction of 111 transcripts was regulated in heart failure (HF) and during VAD-support. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of paired VAD- and NF-samples revealed separation of HF- and NF- samples, however individual differentiation of VAD-implantation and VAD-transplantation was not accomplished. Clustering of pulsatile and non-pulsatile VAD did not lead to robust separation of gene expression patterns. During VAD-support myocardial gene expression changes do not indicate reversal of the HF-phenotype, but reveal a distinct HF-related pattern. Transcriptome analysis of pulsatile and non-pulsatile VAD-supported hearts did not provide evidence for a pump-mode specific transcriptome pattern. Microarrays were used to elucidate the differences between non-failing control hearts and those, suffering from end-stage heart failure pre and post mechanical unloading."	"GEO"	"partial"

"GSE22544"	"Integration of transcript expression, copy number and LOH analysis of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast: expression analysis"	"Introduction: A major challenge in the interpretation of genomic profiling data generated from breast cancer samples is the identification of driver genes as distinct from bystander genes which do not impact tumorigenesis. One way to assess the relative importance of alterations in the transcriptome profile is to combine complementary analyses that assess changes in the copy number alterations (CNAs). This integrated analysis permits the identification of genes with altered expression that map within specific chromosomal regions that demonstrate copy number alterations, providing a mechanistic approach to identify the 'driver genes . Methods: We have performed whole genome analysis of CNAs using the Affymetrix 250K Mapping array on 22 infiltrating ductal carcinoma samples (IDCs). Analysis of transcript expression alterations was performed using the Affymetrix U133 Plus2.0 array on 16 IDC samples. Twelve IDC samples were analyzed using both platforms and the data integrated. We also incorporated data from LOH analysis to identify genes showing loss of expression in LOH regions. Results: Copy number analysis results demarcated smaller boundaries for many previously reported CNAs, and in some cases, the CNAs were defined as more than a single contiguous event. Additionally, we were able to assign driver genes to these commonly reported regions using a rigorous methodology. For example, RAB25 showed a large increased expression in the tumors and mapped to the commonly reported amplification at 1q22. We also identified 5 genes in the 8q24 amplicon and TSEN4 in the 17q25 amplified region. LOH analysis confirmed some previously reported regions, and integration with copy number data determined that the detected LOH were copy neutral events. Finally, we have identified several RXR pathways that demonstrated down-regulation in IDC whose members may represent further targets of therapeutic intervention. Conclusion: We have demonstrated the utility of the application of integrated analysis using high-resolution CGH and whole genome transcript analysis for detecting driver genes in IDC. The high resolution platform allowed a refined demarcation of CNAs, and gene expression profiling provided a mechanism to detect genes directly impacted by the CNA. This is the first report of LOH in IDC using a high resolution platform. 16 IDC samples analyzed with the U133 Plus 2.0 array compared to 4 normal control samples."	"GEO"	"partial"

Developmental in situ hybridization was conducted for 1,045 genes dynamically expressed by microarray analysis. In this way, we identified markers that stably labeled each major hypothalamic nucleus over the entire course of neurogenesis, and thus constructed a detailed molecular atlas of the developing hypothalamus. As proof of concept for the utility of this data, we used these markers to analyze the phenotype of mice where Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) was selectively deleted from hypothalamic neuroepithelium, demonstrating an essential role for Shh in anterior hypothalamic patterning. Our results serve as a resource for functional investigations of hypothalamic development, connectivity, physiology, and dysfunction.

Using an unbiased genetic approach in a mouse model, Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) influencing anxiety-like behaviors and beta-carboline-induced seizure vulnerability have been mapped to the distal portion of mouse chromosome 10 and an interval specific congenic strain (ISCS; A.B6chr10; 66 cM to telomere) was developed. This A.B6chr10 strain facilitated defining the behavioral influences of this region as well as gene expression profiling to identify candidate gene(s) underlying this QTL. By microarray studies, an unsuspected E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, Ring Finger 41 (Rnf41 / Neuregulin Receptor Degrading Protein1; Nrdp1) was differentially expressed in the region of interest, comparing the hippocampi of A/J vs A.B6chr10 mice as well as A/J vs B6 mice. By RT-PCR, Rnf41 expression levels were significantly increased 1.5 and 1.3-fold in the hippocampi of C57BL6/J and A.B6chr10 mice compared to A/J mice, respectively. In addition, protein levels of Rnf41 were increased in hippocampi of B6 mice compared to A/J mice across postnatal development with a 5.5-fold difference at P56. Among LxS recombinant inbred mice (N=33), Rnf41 hippocampal mRNA expression levels were significantly correlated with open field behavior (r= .454, p=.0073). Re-analyzing a microarray database of human post-mortem prefrontal cortex (Brodmann s Area 46/10), RNF41 mRNA expression levels were reduced significantly in patients with major depression and bipolar disorder compared to unaffected controls. Overall, Rnf41 is a pleiotropic candidate gene for anxiety-like behaviors, depression, and vulnerability to seizures. RNF41 and its binding partners provide novel etiological pathways for influencing behavior, highlighting a potential role for the ubiquitin proteasome system in psychiatric illness.

"GSE21539"	"Comparison of expression data between control and Ovo1 morphant zebrafish embryos"	"A fundamental issue in cell biology is how migratory cell behaviors are controlled by dynamically regulated cell adhesion. Vertebrate neural crest (NC) cells rapidly alter cadherin expression and localization at the cell surface during migration. Secreted Wnts induce some of these changes in NC adhesion and also promote specification of NC-derived pigment cells. Here, we show that the zebrafish transcription factor Ovo1 is a Wnt target gene that controls migration of pigment precursors by regulating the intracellular movements of N-cadherin (Ncad). Ovo1 genetically interacts with Ncad and its depletion causes Ncad to accumulate inside cells. Ovo1-deficient embryos strongly upregulate factors involved in intracellular trafficking, including several rab GTPases, known to modulate cellular localization of cadherins. Surprisingly, NC cells express high levels of many of these rab genes in the early embryo, chemical inhibitors of Rab functions rescue NC development in Ovo1-deficient embryos and overexpression of a Rab-interacting protein leads to similar defects in NC migration. These results suggest that Ovo proteins link Wnt signaling to intracellular trafficking pathways that localize Ncad in NC cells and allow them to migrate. Similar processes probably occur in other cell types in which Wnt signaling promotes migration. Total RNA from control and Ovo1 morphant, sox10(7.2):gfp transgenic embryos was isolated using Trizol reagent (Gibco/BRL) from 12 hpf embryos, when morphants first show NC defects.

Here, we used two mouse lines overexpressing human A53T-SNCA around ages 6 and 18 months and studied striatal dysfunction in the absence of neurodegeneration to understand early disease mechanisms. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis of striatal neurotransmitter content demonstrated that dopamine (DA) levels correlated directly with the level of expression of SNCA, an observation also observed in SNCA deficient mice. In the striatum of aged A53TSNCA overexpressing mice, where DA levels were elevated, a paradoxical upregulation of dopamine receptors DRD1A and DRD2 was detected by immunoblots and autoradiography, findings compatible with the notion of abnormal vesicle release. Extensive transcriptome studies via microarrays and quantitative real-time RT-PCR validation of altered Homer1, Cb1, Atf2 and Pde7b transcript levels indicated a progressive reduction in the postsynaptic DA response. As functional consequences, long term depression was absent in corticostriatal slices from aged transgenic mice and an insidious decrease of spontaneous locomotor activity of these animals was found in open field tests.

The fetal liver, and to a lesser extent the neonatal liver, exhibited dramatic differences in gene expression compared to adults. Canonical pathway analysis of the fetal liver signature demonstrated increases in functions important in cell replication and DNA fidelity whereas most metabolic pathways of intermediary metabolism were suppressed. Comparison of the dataset to a number of previously published datasets revealed 1) a striking similarity between the fetal liver and that of the pancreas in both mice and humans, 2) a nucleated erythrocyte signature in the fetus and 3) suppression of most xenobiotic metabolism genes throughout development, except a number of transporters associated with expression in hematopoietic cells. Keywords: gene expression/microarray We characterized gene expression changes in the developing mouse liver at gestational days (GD) 19 and in the neonate (postnatal day (PND) 7 and 30) using full-genome microarrays and compared these changes to that in the adult liver.

Through a series of data mining and comparisons with the transcriptome during mouse embryogenesis and the disparate genomic data in human embryonic stem cells, we revealed that development potential during early human organogenesis is orchestrated by two dominant categories of genes. Specifically, most gradually induced genes are largely differentiation related whereas those gradually repressed are involved in both stemness- and differentiation-relevant aspects of the developmental potential. Further through integrative mining we uncovered a molecular network that well characterizes stemness- and differentiation-relevant aspects of developmental potentials during early human organogenesis. Analysis of published data showed that the network could serve to evaluate various differentiation models. Our results make a significant step towards understanding of human embryogenesis at a molecular level and suggest that developmental potentials are under control of shared regulatory events. With the consent of subjects and of the Ethical Review Board of the Xinhua Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine,we collected human post-implantation embryos at six successive time periods: Carnegie Stages 9 to 14 (E20 to E32), covering the first third of organogenesis. Using the Affymetrix HG-U133A Genechip microarrays, three replicates were independently profiled for each stage to minimize the influence of the embryo-to-embryo variation. Raw expression data were normalized using Robust Multi-array Averaging (RMA) with quantile normalization. The resultant expression data were imported into Extraction of Differential Gene Expression (EDGE) software for the detection of probesets exhibiting the consistent changes within the triplicates and differential expression (denoted as hORG expression matrix). The hORG expression matrix was subjected to Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) bioconductor library for identification of stage-transitive transcriptome changes, and self-organizing map combined with singular value decomposition (SOM-SVD) as well as SOM-based two-phase gene clustering for the topology-preserving extraction of temporal expression patterns.

We performed metabolome, proteome, and transciptome profiling with Drosophila treated with methamphetamine. The proteomic profiling revealed responses associated with known physiological problems that occur with methamphetamine usage in mammals. The metabolomic result showed that the metabolite trehalose was decreased significantly after methamphetamine exposure, suggesting an oxidative stress response to this drug.

Method: We compared gene expression and development of mouse blastocysts produced by intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection and cultured in Whitten's medium (ICSIWM) or KSOM medium with amino acids (ICSIKSOMaa) with control blastocysts flushed out of the uterus on post coital day 3.5 (In vivo). Global pattern of gene expression was assessed using the Affymetrix 430 2.0 chip. In addition we compared gene expression in embryos generated in IVF or ICSI using WM. Results: Blastocysts resulting from ICSI fertilization have a reduction in the number of trophoblastic and inner cell mass cells compared to in vivo generated embryos. Approximately 1000 genes are different between ICSI blastocyst and in vivo blastocysts; proliferation, apoptosis and morphogenetic pathways are the most common pathways altered after in vitro culture. Unexpectedly, only 41 genes were statistically different between embryo cultured in suboptimal conditions (WM) or optimal conditions (KSOMaa).

Both a microdeletion and its reciprocal microduplication mapping to mouse chromosome 11 (MMU11), which model the rearrangements present in Smith-Magenis (SMS) and Potocki-Lupski (PTLS) syndromes patients, respectively, have been engineered. We profiled the transcriptome of five different tissues affected in human patients in mice with 1n (Deletion/+), 2n (+/+), 3n (Duplication/+) and uniallelic 2n (Deletion/Duplication) copies of the same region in an identical genetic background. The most differentially expressed transcripts between the four studied genotypes were ranked. A highly significant propensity, are mapping to the engineered SMS/PTLS interval in the different tissues. A statistically significant overrepresentation of the genes mapping to the flanks of the engineered interval was also found in the top-ranked differentially expressed genes. A phenomenon efficient across multiple cell lineages and that extends along the entire length of the chromosome, tens of megabases from the breakpoints. These long-range effects are unidirectional and uncoupled from the number of copies of the copy number variation (CNV) genes. Thus, our results suggest that the assortment of genes mapping to a chromosome is not random. They also indicate that a structural change at a given position of the human genome may cause the same perturbation in particular pathways regardless of gene dosage. An issue that should be considered in appreciating the contribution of this class of variation to phenotypic features.

However, there has been no report on the long-term effects of chlorella ingestion on immunity. In the present study, 4- to 10-week-old (young) and 4- to 50-week-old (old) female BALB/c mice were sensitized or not with ovalbumin (OVA), and given basic diet containing chlorella powder at 2% or basic diet alone. The effects of chlorella ingestion on immunity were investigated by measurement of splenic cytokines and immunoglobulin (Ig), analysis of T- and B-cells in the spleen and small intestine by flow cytometry, and analysis of the liver by DNA microarray. Results were compared between the young and old, OVA-sensitized and -nonsensitized, and chlorella and non-chlorella ingestion groups. Production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was maintained in the nonsensitized old groups, and ratios of T-helper type 1 (Th1) to T-helper type 2 (Th2) cells were similar in the young and old groups. In addition, overproduction of OVA-specific Igs due to OVA sensitization was strongly suppressed, and significant immunotolerance was exhibited irrespective of age. In addition, suppression of T-cell decreases in the spleen due to aging and suppression of changes in T- and B-cells due to OVA sensitization in the small intestinal lymph were demonstrated on flow cytometric analyses. On DNA microarray analysis, immune-related terms including IL11 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1 were detected, and expression of genes was shown, which were related to IL1-linked genes and complex involving macrophages from the pathways of cytokines and inflammatory response. In addition, suppressions of declined lipid metabolism and energy production were also suggested. Although how the ingredients in chlorella were involved in these changes is unclear, our findings suggest that prevention of decrease in acquired immunity by aging and induction of strong immunotolerance occurred following chlorella ingestion.

However, their regulatory functions in stages from the blastula to early neurula remain largely unknown, primarily because loss-of-function studies have not been informative to date. In our present study, we systematically knocked down the B1 sox genes in zebrafish. Only the quadruple knockdown of the four B1 sox genes sox2/3/19a/19b, which are active in the early embryo, resulted in very severe developmental abnormalities, confirming that the B1 sox genes are functionally redundant. We characterized the sox2/3/19a/19b quadruple knockdown embryos in detail by examining the changes in gene expression through microarray analysis as well as in situ hybridization. Importantly, these phenotypic analyses of the quadruple knockdown embryos reveled that the B1 SOX proteins regulate the following distinct processes: (1) early dorsoventral patterning by controlling bmp2b/7; (2) gastrulation movements via the regulation of pcdh18a/18b and non-canonical wnt genes; (3) neural differentiation by regulating the Hes-class bHLH gene her3 and the proneural-class bHLH genes neurog1 (positively) and ascl1a (negatively), and regional transcription factor genes, e.g. hesx1, zic1 and rx3; and (4) neural patterning by regulating signaling pathway genes, cyp26a1 in RA signaling, oep in Nodal signaling, shh, and mdkb. These findings indicate that the B1 SOX proteins control a wide range of developmental regulators in the early embryo and suggest that the B1 sox functions are central to coordinating cell fate specification with patterning and morphogenetic processes occurring in the early embryo. Microarray analysis was carried out to compare gene expression profiles at the 30% epiboly (30%E), 75% epiboly (75%E) and tailbud (TB) stages between wild-type embryos and the sox2/3/19a/19b quadruple knockdown embryos.

Here we show that a metabolic program related to the Warburg effect is used during normal Drosophila development and regulated by the fly ortholog of the Estrogen-Related Receptor (ERR) family of nuclear receptors. dERR null mutants die as second instar larvae with abnormally low ATP levels, diminished triacylglyceride stores, and elevated levels of circulating sugars. Metabolomic profiling revealed that the pathways affected in these mutants correspond to those used in the Warburg effect. The expression of active dERR protein in mid-embryogenesis triggers a coordinate switch in gene expression that drives a metabolic program supporting the dramatic growth that occurs during larval development. This study suggests that mammalian ERR family members may promote cancer by directing a metabolic state that supports proliferation. Drosophila larvae were staged at a mid-second instar time point and hand sorted for developmental progression. Individual pools of isogenic animals were collected for each replicate. Three replcates were assayed for each genotype. The two genotypes assayed were a control wild type strain (w1118) and a transheteroallelic combination of err mutant alleles (err1/err2).

Here, we demonstrate that it also affects metabolic plasticity: Rovers show a greater response to changes in their food environment than do sitters. Using metabolic profiling, we define foraging- and food-dependent changes in metabolites indicating that Rover store energy predominantly as lipids, whereas sitter variants store it as carbohydrates, Such changes are reflected in gene expression patterns, indicating an influence of foraging on regulators of insulin signaling. Combining for alleles with mutants of positive insulin signaling regulators makes Rover responses sitter-like, but does not change sitter responses. Collectively these findings suggest that the effect on metabolic plasticity of foraging works through the insulin signaling pathway.

It encodes an RNA-binding protein containing a single maxi-KH domain. Characterization of loss-of-function phenotypes of CG3875 mutants generated by gene targeting demonstrated that CG3875 null males display a seriously reduced fertility compared with wildtype males and most of the null males are completely sterile. Further cytological identification of CG3875 null males suggested that CG3875 plays an important role in spermiogenesis processes including sperm individualization and sperm coiling. In addition, CG3875 is also essential for the formation of outer dynein arm of sperm axoneme. In order to identify the molecular mechanism responsible for the involvement of CG3875 in spermiogenesis and structural integrity of sperm axoneme, we performed microarray analysis to identify transcripts whose levels are altered in the testes of CG3875 null males.

However, although the genomics of mate choice may influence both the likelihood and speed of speciation, the identity and location of genes underlying assortative mating remain largely unknown. Methods and Findings We used mate choice experiments and gene expression analysis of female D. melanogaster to examine three key components influencing speciation. We show that the 1,498 genes in Zimbabwean female Drosophila melanogaster whose expression levels differ when mating with more (Zimbabwean) versus less (Cosmopolitan strain) preferred males include many with high expression in the central nervous system and ovaries, are disproportionately X-linked and form a number of clusters with low recombination distance. Significant involvement of the brain and ovaries is consistent with the action of a combination of pre- and postcopulatory female choice mechanisms, while sex linkage and clustering of genes lead to high potential evolutionary rate and sheltering against the homogenizing effects of gene exchange between populations. Conclusion Taken together our results imply favourable genomic conditions for the evolution of reproductive isolation through mate choice in Zimbabwean D. melanogaster and suggest that mate choice may, in general, act as an even more important engine of speciation than previously realized. We measured gene expression of adult female Drosophila melanogaster from a composite Zimbabwe (Z) strain population named SZ, produced by mixing the genomes of six Z strain isofemale lines, shortly after mating them with either SZ strain or cosmopolitan (M strain) males.

"GSE14517"	"Transcription profiling of Drosophila deficiency hemizygotes and a duplication hemizygote reveals buffering of segmental and chromosomal aneuploidies in Drosophila melanogaster"	"Chromosomal instability which involves deletion and duplication of chromosomes or chromosome parts is a common feature of cancers, and deficiency screens are commonly used as a method to find genes involved in different biological pathways. Still, how gene expression from whole chromosomes or large chromosomal domains is affected by deficiencies, duplications or chromosome loss is largely unknown. Using expression microarrays of deficiency hemizygotes and a duplication hemizygote we show that expressed genes are significantly buffered when present in a deficiency hemizygote and that the buffering effect is general and not mainly caused by feedback regulation of individual genes. Differentially expressed genes are in general better buffered than ubiquitously expressed genes when present in one copy. When present in three copies, differentially expressed genes are in general less buffered than ubiquitously expressed genes. Furthermore, we show that the 4th chromosome is compensated in response to dose differences. Our results suggest that general mechanisms exist to stimulate and to repress gene expression of aneuploidy regions and on the 4th chromosome this compensation is mediated by POF (Painting of Fourth).

Comparison of significantly over and under-expressed genes reveals a signature for dietary restriction and lifespan extension. Abstract A major challenge in translating the positive effects of dietary restriction (DR) for the improvement of human health is the development of therapeutic mimics. One approach to finding DR mimics is based upon identification of the proximal effectors of DR life span extension. Whole genome profiling of DR in Drosophila shows a large number of changes in gene expression, making it difficult to establish which changes are involved in life span determination as opposed to other unrelated physiological changes. We used comparative whole genome expression profiling to discover genes whose change in expression is shared between DR and two molecular genetic life span extending interventions related to DR, increased dSir2 and decreased Dmp53 activity. We find twenty-one genes shared among the three related life span extending interventions. One of these genes, takeout, thought to be involved in circadian rhythms, feeding behavior and juvenile hormone binding is also increased in four other life span extending conditions: Rpd3, Indy, chico and methuselah. We demonstrate takeout is involved in longevity determination by specifically increasing adult takeout expression and extending life span. These studies demonstrate the power of comparative whole genome transcriptional profiling for identifying specific downstream elements of the DR life span extending pathway. 42 samples were used in the analysis.

During dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo, distinct territories and several signaling pathways (JNK, Wingless, Dpp,...) bring their own contribution to the migration of the epithelial sheets. In particular, the ectodermal leading edge, which is specified by the JNK pathway, behaves as a purse-string under the action of an acto-myosin cable and as a zipper under the action of cellular extensions. How the leading edge, which is supposed to be a uniform raw of cell, integrates the input of the different signaling pathways is poorly understood. We used microarrays to identify genes whose expression is regulated by the JNK pathway during dorsal closure of the Drosophila embryo. Three genetic conditions were compared: wild-type (WT), gain of function (GOF) and loss of function (LOF). For the GOF embryos, the JNK pathway was strongly activated by expressing HepACT in the ectoderm using the UAS-GAL4 system (69B-GAL4). For the LOF embryos, we used a combination of 2 alleles, heprev75 and hep1. Carefully staged embryos, corresponding to stages 13 and 14, were collected and for each condition, three independent RNA samples were prepared to be hybridized on the microarrays."	"GEO"	"partial"		
"GSE23346"	"CrebA is a major and direct regulator of secretory pathway gene expression"	"Abstract: Secretion occurs in all cells, with relatively low levels in most cells and extremely high levels in specialized secretory cells, such as those of the pancreas, salivary and mammary glands. Here, we report that the CrebA/Creb3-like family of bZip transcription factors functions to upregulate expression of both the general protein machinery required in all cells for secretion and of cell-type specific secreted proteins. Drosophila CrebA directly binds the enhancers of secretory pathway genes and is both necessary and sufficient to activate expression of every secretory pathway component gene examined thus far. Microarray profiling reveals that CrebA also upregulates expression of genes encoding cell type specific secreted components. Finally, we find that the human CrebA orthologues, Creb3L1 and Creb3L2, have the ability to upregulate the secretory pathway in non-secretory cell types. Goals: The goals of the microarray experiments were to identify additional targets of the CrebA transcription factor to learn the range of genes regulated by this transcription factor during embryogenesis. Previous work had indicated that CrebA upregulates the protein machinery of the early secretory pathway. Our new data now shows that in addition to the protein machinery, CrebA also upregulates genes encoding the protein cargo that is secreted from specialized secretory organs. RNA was isolated from stage 11-15 wild type Drosophila embryos and compared to RNA from CrebA null mutant embryos of the same age; all samples were hybridized to the Drosophila Genome 2.0 Affymetrix array.

This is crucial for regulation of fat content in adult flies. Finding the target of this microRNA is crucial for understanding the regulation of ilp gene expression. We used microarrays to identify genes that are upregulated specifically in the neuronal IPCs in the microRNA mutants. Drosophila adult head RNA was extracted and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays. We reared animals from early larval stages in controlled growth and feeding conditions. RNA was extracted from 5-day-old adult males. We collected RNA from control, homozygous dme-miR-14 mutants and mutants expressing dme-miR-14 microRNA specifically in the IPCs (rescue). We were interested in genes that were upregulated in the mutants and were restored or reduced to control levels in the rescue condition. Two biological replicates per sample type were performed."

"GSE12834"	"Immunogenic males: a genome-wide analysis of reproduction and the cost of mating in Drosophila melanogaster females"	"In Drosophila melanogaster, mating radically transforms female physiology and behavior. Post-mating responses include an increase in the oviposition rate, a reduction in female receptivity, and an activation of the immune system . The fitness consequences of mating are similarly dramatic -females must mate once in order to produce fertile eggs, but additional matings have a clear negative effect. Previously, microarrays have been used to examine gene expression of females differing in their reproductive status with the aim of identifying genes influenced by mating. However, since only virgin and single mated females were compared, transcriptional changes associated with reproduction (under natural selection) and the effects of male-induced harm (under sexually antagonistic selection) cannot be disentangled. We partitioned these fundamentally different effects by instead examining the expression profiles of virgin, single mated and double mated females. We found substantial effects relating to reproduction and further effects that are only attributable to a second mating. Immune response genes dominate this male-induced harm effect indicating that the cost of mating may be due partly to this system's activation. We propose that both sexually antagonistic and natural selection have been important in the evolution of the innate immunity genes, thereby contributing to the sexual dimorphismand rapid evolution at these loci. Keywords: Female response to mating Female flies were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen either as virgins or 6 hours after mating and stored at -80 C until RNA extraction was performed (not more than 2 days). 8 whole flies -randomly selected within each treatment- were pooled for each extraction.

"GSE22689"	"Chromosomal Fragile Site FRA16D tumor suppressor gene Wwox contributes to aerobic metabolism and oxidative stress response"	"he WWOX gene spans chromosomal fragile site FRA16D, a region of DNA instability in cancer. While WWOX has some tumor suppressor characteristics, its normal role and functional contribution to cancer are unclear. Drosophila homozygous Wwox mutants are viable with no discernable phenotype. Drosophila Wwox interactors, identified by proteomics and micro-array analyses, mainly have roles in aerobic metabolism. Functional relationships between Wwox and either isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) or superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1) were confirmed by phenotype modification, including Sod1 ""crinkled-wing"", indicative of oxidative stress response. Endogenous reactive oxygen species levels reflect Wwox levels in Drosophila. WWOX mRNA levels in Drosophila and human cells correlate with IDH and Sod1 levels. Wwox therefore contributes to pathways involving glucose metabolism and oxidative stress response. Drosophila embryos were harvested between 4-8hrs and total RNA isolated to look for gene-expression differences induced by the presence of one of two altered Wwox alleles relative to wild-type. The two alleles were Wwox (a null mutation generated by homologous recombination) and Wwoxf04545 carrying a pBac insertion in exon 2 (O'Keefe et al., 2005, 2007).

Here, we report that Tbr1, a transcription factor expressed in postmitotic projection neurons, exerts positive and negative control over both regional (areal) and laminar identity. Tbr1 null mice exhibited profound defects of frontal cortex and layer 6 differentiation, as indicated by down-regulation of gene-expression markers such as Bcl6 and Cdh9. Conversely, genes that implement caudal cortex and layer 5 identity, such as Bhlhb5 and Fezf2, were up-regulated in Tbr1 mutants. Tbr1 implements frontal identity in part by direct promoter binding and activation of Auts2, a frontal cortex gene implicated in autism. Tbr1 regulates laminar identity in part by downstream activation or maintenance of Sox5, an important transcription factor controlling neuronal migration and corticofugal axon projections. Similar to Sox5 mutants, Tbr1 mutants exhibit ectopic axon projections to the hypothalamus and cerebral peduncle. Together, our findings show that Tbr1 coordinately regulates regional and laminar identity of postmitotic cortical neurons.

"GSE22693"	"Regulation of gene expression program by Fsp27 in white and brown adipose tissue"	"Background: Brown and white adipose tissues (BAT and WAT) play critical roles in controlling energy homeostasis and in the development of obesity and diabetes. Fsp27 is expressed in both BAT and WAT and promotes lipid storage and the development of obesity and diabetes. In addition, Fsp27-deficient white adipocytes acquired certain BAT-like properties including reduced lipid droplet size and increased mitochondrial activity. Using microarray and semi-quantitative real-time PCR analyses, we systematically analyzed the gene expression profile in Fsp27-deficient WAT and BAT. Results: We observed that BAT-selective genes were significantly up-regulated, whereas WAT-selective genes were down-regulated in the WAT of Fsp27-/- mice. Expression levels of BAT-selective genes were also dramatically up-regulated in the WAT of leptin and Fsp27 double deficient mice. Furthermore, we observed that expression levels of genes in multiple metabolic pathways including oxidative phosphorylation, the TCA cycle and fatty acid synthesis and oxidation were increased in the Fsp27-/- WAT. In contrast, expression levels for extracellular matrix remodeling, the classic complement pathway and TGF-_ signaling""were down-regulated in the WAT of Fsp27-/- mice. Most importantly, regulatory factors that determine BAT identity such as CEBP_/_, PRDM16 and major components in the cAMP pathway were markedly up-regulated in the WAT of Fsp27-/- mice. Interestingly, we observed distinct gene expression profiles in the BAT of Fsp27-/- mice. Conclusion: Our data suggest that Fsp27 acts at upstream to control gene expression of diverse pathways, in particular the expression of regulatory factors that determine the identity of BAT and WAT. Therefore, Fsp27 is an important molecular determinant for the identity of WAT, and loss of Fsp27 leads to the conversion of WAT to a BAT-like tissue. Total RNAs were extracted from individual gonadal WAT of five pairs of 3-month-old wild-type and Fsp27-null male mice. Equal amounts of RNA from five pairs of mice with each genotype were pooled to form RNA pools (total 45 _g). Duplicate experiments were carried out."	"GEO"	"partial"		
"GSE8715"	"Transcriptional Profiling of the Megabladder Mouse - A Unique Model of Bladder Dysmorphogenesis"	"Recent studies in our lab have identified a mutant mouse model of obstructive nephropathy designated mgb for megabladder. Homozygotic mgb mice (mgb-/-) develop lower urinary tract obstruction in utero due to a lack of bladder smooth muscle differentiation. This defect is the result of a random transgene insertion into chromosome 16 followed by a translocation of this fragment into chromosome 11. In an effort to identify potential gene targets affected in mgb mice, we performed transcriptional profiling on embryonic day 15 (E15) mgb-/- bladders using both a Chromosome 11/16 Custom GeneChip Array and the Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 GeneChip. This analysis identified no definitive mis-expressed gene targets on chromosome 11. In contrast, mgb-/- mice significantly over-expressed a cluster of gene products located on the translocated fragment of chromosome 16 including urotensin II-related peptide (Urp), which was shown to be preferentially over-expressed in developing mgb-/- bladders. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that the spatial distribution of Urp was altered in mgb-/- bladders, while biochemical studies suggested a potential role for Urp in modifying smooth muscle cell phenotype in vitro. Pathway analysis of mgb microarray data showed dysregulation of at least 60 gene products associated with the differentiation of smooth muscle. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the molecular pathways controlling normal smooth muscle development are severely altered in mgb-/- bladders, and provide the first evidence that Urp may play a critical role in bladder smooth muscle development. Keywords: mgb mutant bladders Gene expression profiling was performed on two separate study groups.

"GSE20411"	"The effects of aging vs. alpha7 nAChR subunit deficiency on the mouse brain transcriptome"	"Aging is accompanied by expression changes in multiple genes and the brain is one of the tissues most vulnerable to aging. Since the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive decline during aging, we hypothesized that its absence might affect gene expression profiles in aged brains. To study whether transcriptional changes occur due to aging, alpha7 deficiency or both, we analyzed whole brain transcriptomes of young (8 week) and aged (2 year) alpha7 deficient and wild-type control mice, using Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarray. Highly significant expression changes were detected in 47 and 1543 genes (after Bonferroni and FDR correction) in the brains of aged mice compared to young mice, regardless of their genotype. These included genes involved in immune system function and ribosome structure, as well as genes that were previously demonstrated as differentially expressed in aging human brains. Genotype-dependent changes were detected in only 3 genes, Chrna7 which encodes the alpha7 nAChR subunit, and two closely linked genes, likely due to a mouse background effect. Expression changes dependent on age-genotype interaction were detected in 207 genes (with a low significance threshold). Age-dependent differential expression levels were approved in all nine genes that were chosen for validation by real-time RT-PCR. Our results suggest that the robust effect of aging on brain transcription clearly overcomes the almost negligible effect of alpha7 nAChR subunit deletion, and that germline deficiency of this subunit has a minor effect on brain expression profile in aged mice.

To define its intracellular signaling mechanisms by which BMP4 regulates lung development, BMP-specific Smad1 or Smad5 was selectively knocked out in fetal mouse lung epithelial cells. Abrogation of lung epithelial-specific Smad1, but not Smad5, resulted in retardation of lung branching morphogenesis and reduced sacculation, accompanied by altered distal lung epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, and consequently severe neonatal respiratory failure. By combining cDNA microarray with ChIP-chip analyses, Wnt inhibitory factor-1 (Wif1) was identified as a novel target gene of Smad1 in the developing mouse lung epithelial cells. Loss of Smad1 transcriptional activation of Wif1 expression was associated with reduced Wif1 expression and increased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activity in lung epithelia, resulting in specific fetal lung abnormalities. Therefore, a novel regulatory loop of BMP4-Smad1-Wif1-Wnt/beta-catenin in coordinating BMP and Wnt pathways to control fetal lung development is suggested. mRNA profiling: Total RNA was isolated from left lobe lungs of three pair of E18.5 wild type and Smad1 lung epithelium-specific conditional knockout mice"	"GEO"	"partial"

Because of the phenotypic parallels to the Foxn1nu (nude) mutant mice, we tested whether Hoxc13 and Foxn1 act in a common pathway of hair follicle (HF) differentiation. We show that the alopecia exhibited by both the Hoxc13tm1Mrc and Foxn1nu mice is due to strikingly similar defects in hair shaft differentiation and that both mutants suffer from a severe nail dystrophy. These similarities are consistent with the overlap of Hoxc13 and Foxn1 expression patterns in the HF and nail matrix. DNA microarray analysis of scapular skin from Hoxc13tm1Mrc mutant (mut) compared to wild type (wt) mice identified Foxn1 as significantly down-regulated along with numerous hair keratin genes.

This microarray study examines gene expression induced in the C57BL/6J mouse retina by hyperoxia over the 14-day period during which photoreceptors first resist, then succumb to, hyperoxia. METHODS: Young adult C57BL/6J mice were exposed to hyperoxia (75% oxygen) for up to 14 days. On day 0 (control), day 3, day 7, and day 14, retinal RNA was extracted and processed on Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays. Microarray data were analyzed using GCOS Version 1.4 and GeneSpring Version 7.3.1. RESULTS: The overall numbers of hyperoxia-regulated genes increased monotonically with exposure. Within that increase, however, a distinctive temporal pattern was apparent. At 3 days exposure, there was prominent upregulation of genes associated with neuroprotection. By day 14, these early-responsive genes were downregulated, and genes related to cell death were strongly expressed. At day 7, the regulation of these genes was mixed, indicating a possible transition period from stability at day 3 to degeneration at day 14. CONCLUSIONS: Microarray analysis of the response of the retina to prolonged hyperoxia demonstrated a temporal pattern involving early neuroprotection and later cell death, and provided insight into the mechanisms involved in the two phases of response. As hyperoxia is a consistent feature of the late stages of photoreceptor degenerations, understanding the mechanisms of oxygen toxicity may be important therapeutically. 4 timepoints in total, 0d (control), 3d, 7d and 14d and a replicate per timepoint.

"GSE16675"	"The influence of segmental copy number variation on tissue transcriptomes through development"	"A preliminary understanding of the phenotypic effect of copy number variation (CNV) of DNA segments is emerging. These rearrangements were demonstrated to influence, in a somewhat dose-dependent manner, the expression of genes mapping within. They were shown to also affect the expression of genes located on their flanks, sometimes at great distance. Here, we show by monitoring these effects at multiple life stages, that these controls over expression are effective throughout mouse development. Similarly, we observe that the more specific spatial expression patterns of CNV genes are maintained throughout life. However, we find that some brain-expressed genes appear to be under compensatory loops only at specific time-points, indicating that the influence of CNVs on these genes is modulated through development. We also observe that CNV genes are significantly enriched upon transcripts that show variable time-course of expression in different strains. Thus modifying the number of copy of a gene not only potentially alters its expression level, but possibly also its time of expression.

AVP maintains water balance by promoting water conservation at the level of the kidney. Dehydration evokes a massive increase in the regulated release of AVP from SON axon terminals located in the posterior pituitary, and this is accompanied by a plethora of changes in the morphology, electrophysiological properties, biosynthetic and secretory activity of this structure. Microarray analysis was used to generate a definitive catalogue of the genes expressed in the mouse SON, and to describe how the gene expression profile changes in response to dehydration. Comparison of the genes differentially expressed in the mouse SON as a consequence of dehydration with those of the rat has revealed many similarities, pointing to common processes underlying the function-related plasticity in this nucleus. In addition we have identified many genes that are differentially expressed in a species-specific manner. However, in many cases, we have found that the hyperosmotic cue can induce species-specific alterations in the expression of different genes in the same pathway. The same functional end can be served by different means, via differential modulation, in different species, of different molecules in the same pathway. We suggest that pathways, rather than specific genes, should be the focus of integrative physiological studies based on transcriptome data. Animals.

The study showed that 2 months of ranolazine treatment improved cardiac function of 18 month-old apoE-deficient mice with symptoms of heart failure as assessed by echocardiography. To identify changes in cardiac gene expression induced by treatment with ranolazine a microarray study was performed with heart tissue from failing hearts relative to ranolazine-treated and healthy control hearts. The microarray approach identified heart failure-specific genes that were normalized during treatment with the anti-ischemic drug ranolazine. Microarray gene expression profiling was performed with heart tissue isolated from (i) untreated 18 month-old apoE-deficient mice with heart failure relative to (ii) 18 month-old apoE-deficient mice treated for two months with the anti-ischemic drug ranolazine (200 mg/kg), and (iii) age-matched non-transgenic C57BL/6J (B6) control mice."

"GSE18742"	"Increased Expression of Angiogenic Genes in the Brains of Mouse Meg3-null Embryos"	"MEG3 (Maternally Expressed Gene 3) is a non-coding RNA that is highly expressed in the normal human brain and pituitary. Expression of MEG3 is lost in gonadotroph-derived clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas. Meg3 knock-out mice were generated to identify targets and potential functions of this gene in embryonic development and tumorigenesis. Gene expression profiles were compared in the brains of Meg3-null embryos and wild-type litter-mate controls using microarray analysis. Microarray data were analyzed with GeneSifter which uses Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and Gene Ontology (GO) classifications to identify signaling cascades and functional categories of interest within the data set. Differences were found in signaling pathways and ontologies related to angiogenesis between wild-type and knock-out embryos. Quantitative RT-PCR and histological staining showed increased expression of some VEGF pathway genes and increased cortical microvessel density in the knock-out embryos. These results are consistent with reported increases in VEGF signaling observed in human clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas. In conclusion, Meg3 may play an important role in control of vascularization in the brain and may function as a tumor suppressor by preventing angiogenesis.

We hypothesized that healthy individuals exposed to low levels of tobacco smoke must have biologic changes in the small airway epithelium compared to healthy unexposed individuals. Methods: Small airway epithelium was obtained by bronchoscopy from 121 individuals; microarrays assessed genome wide gene expression, and urine nicotine and cotinine were used to categorized subjects as nonsmokers, active smokers, and low exposure. The gene expression data was used to determine the threshold and ID50 of urine nicotine and cotinine at which the small airway epithelium showed abnormal responses. Results: There was no threshold of urine nicotine without an abnormal small airway epithelial response, and only a slightly above detectable threshold abnormal response for cotinine. The nicotine ID50 for nicotine was 25 ng/ml and cotinine 104 ng/ml. Conclusions: The small airway epithelium detects and responds to low levels of tobacco smoke with transcriptome modifications. This provides biologic correlates of epidemiologic studies linking low level tobacco smoke exposure to lung health risk, health, identifies genes in the lung cells most sensitive to tobacco smoke and defines thresholds at the lung epithelium responds to inhaled tobacco smoke. Affymetrix arrays were used to assess the gene expression data of smoking-responsive genes in the in small airway epithelium obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy of 48 healthy non-smokers (non-smoker or Nsaets), 65 healthy smokers (smoker), 7 symptomatic smokers (SYMs) and a healthy occasional smoker (OcSs).

Since there are no medical therapies, surgery and/or radiation are the only therapeutic options. To identify dysregulated genes and/or pathways that may play a role in tumorigenesis and/ or progression, molecular profiling was performed on 14 gonadotrope tumors and 9 normal human pituitaries from autopsy samples. Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed clear discrimination between tumor and normal pituitary gene expression profiles. Bioinformatic analysis identified specific genes and pathways that were highly differentially regulated, including a cohort of putative downstream effectors of p53 were repressed in gonadotrope pituitary tumors, including GADD45____, GADD45____ and Reprimo with concomitant downregulation of the upstream regulator, PLAGL1. PLAGL1 reexpression in gonadotrope cells did not directly modulate the downstream targets. Further functional analysis of GADD45____ was performed. Overexpression of GADD45____ in mouse gonadotrope cells blocked proliferation, increased rates of apoptosis in response to growth factor withdrawal and increased colony formation in soft agar. In contrast to prior studies with GADD45____, methylation interference assays showed no evidence of epigenetic modification of the GADD45____ promoter in pituitary tumors. Thus, our data suggest that many components downstream of p53 are suppressed in gonadotrope pituitary tumors. A novel candidate, GADD45____ is low in tumors and reexpression blocks proliferation, survival and tumorigenesis in gonadotrope cells. Unlike GADD45____, GADD45____ is not methylated to block its expression. Together these studies identify new targets and mechanisms to explore concerning pituitary tumor initiation and progression. To elucidate mechanisms involved in pituitary tumorigenesis and progression, we performed individual gene expression microarray analysis using Affy U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChips comparing 14 gonadotrope tumors with 9 normal pituitary samples obtained at autopsy."

Discovery and identification of septic shock subclasses could provide the foundation for the design of more specifically targeted therapies. Herein we tested the hypothesis that pediatric septic shock subclasses can be discovered through genome-wide expression profiling. Methods: Genome-wide expression profiling was conducted using whole blood-derived RNA from 98 children with septic shock, followed by a series of bioinformatic approaches targeted at subclass discovery and characterization. Results: Three putative subclasses (subclasses A, B, and C) were initially identified based on an empiric, discovery-oriented expression filter and unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Statistical comparison of the 3 putative subclasses (ANOVA, Bonferonni correction, p < 0.05) identified 6,934 differentially regulated genes. K means clustering of these 6,934 genes generated 10 coordinately regulated gene clusters corresponding to multiple signaling and metabolic pathways, all of which were differentially regulated across the 3 subclasses. Leave one out cross validation procedures indentified 100 genes having the strongest predictive values for subclass identification. Forty-four of these 100 genes corresponded to signaling pathways relevant to the adaptive immune system and glucocorticoid receptor signaling, the majority of which were repressed in subclass A patients. Subclass A patients were also characterized by repression of genes corresponding to zinc-related biology. Phenotypic analyses revealed that subclass A patients were younger, had a higher illness severity, and a higher mortality rate than patients in subclasses B and C. Conclusions: Genome-wide expression profiling can identify pediatric septic shock subclasses having clinically relevant phenotypes. Expression data from 98 children with septic shock and 32 normal controls were generated using whole blood-derived RNA samples representing the first 24 hours of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit.

We previously addressed this heterogeneity by indentifying 3 putative subclasses of children with septic shock based on a 100-gene expression signature corresponding to adaptive immunity and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Herein we attempted to prospectively validate the existence of these gene expression-based subclasses in a validation cohort. Methods: Gene expression mosaics were generated from the 100 class-defining genes for 82 individual patients in the validation cohort. Patients were classified into 1 of 3 subclasses (A, B, or C) based on color and pattern similarity relative to reference mosaics generated from the original derivation cohort. Separate classifications were conducted by 21 individual clinicians and a computer-based algorithm. After subclassification the clinical database was mined for clinical phenotyping. Results: In the final consensus subclassification generated by clinicians, subclass A patients had a higher illness severity, as measured by illness severity scores and maximal organ failure, relative to subclasses B and C. The k coefficient across all possible inter-evaluator comparisons was 0.633. Similar observations were made based on the computer-generated subclassification. Patients in subclass A were also characterized by repression of a large number of genes having functional annotations related to zinc biology. Conclusions: We have validated the existence of subclasses of children with septic shock based on a biologically relevant, 100-gene expression signature. The subclasses can be indentified by clinicians without formal bioinformatics training, at a clinically relevant time point, and have clinically relevant phenotypic differences.

Although tumors arising in these various locations demonstrate similar morphology, it is unclear whether the gene expression profiles are similar in the upper tract (ureter and renal pelvis) or in the lower tract (bladder and urethra) carcinomas, especially given their different embryologic origins. As differences may facilitate potentially different screening and treatment modalities, we sought to examine the relationship between urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis (rUC) and urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (bUC). Fresh tumor tissue was collected from patients with bUC (n=10) and benign mucosa from the bladder (n=7) was collected from individuals undergoing resection for non-UC conditions for comparison. Gene expression profiles from these samples were determined using high-throughput Affymetrix gene expression microarray chips. Bioinformatic approaches were used to compare gene expression profiles of these samples and those of rUC (n= 14) and normal kidney (n=14) that were mostly used in our previous publication. Using unsupervised analytic approaches, rUC and bUC were indistinguishable. When supervised analytic approach was used, a very small number of potentially differentially expressed genes was identified; these differences were most likely to be limited to a single pathway - the chloride ion binding activity pathway -which was more frequently activated in rUC than in bUC. We found that the gene expression profiles of UCs from the upper and lower tract were extremely similar, suggesting that similar pathogenic mechanisms likely function in the development of these tumors. The differential expression of genes in the identified pathway may represent a potential new avenue for detection of upper tract tumors.

Based on the tight association to the HLA-DQB1*0602 haplotype in caucasians, it could be hypotesized an immunological dysregulation underlying the pathogenesis of the disease. Design: 10 NRLCP patients with 10 healthy controls were compared. Total RNA isolated from blood specimens was analyzed using microarray technology followed by statistical data analysis to detect genome-wide differential gene expression between patients and controls. Functional analysis of the genelist was performed in order to interpret the biological significance of the data. Results: 173 genes showed significant (p<0.01) differential expression between the two tested conditions. The biological interpretation allowed to categorize differentially expressed genes into main functional groups including includes genes involved in brain development, which could be possibly regarded as peripheral markers of the disease, along with molecular markers of the NRLCP-related dysmetabolic syndrome and immuregulatory molecules. Moreover a striking correlation within selected HLA haplotypes and HLA gene expression was detected, indicating an allele-specific trend of gene expression for the DQB1, DQA1 and DRB4 genes across all the tested subject, regardless of the disease status.

Ex vivo mitochondrial density, quality and functioning was comparable between pre-diabetic subjects and matched controls, however, gene expression analysis showed a switch from carbohydrate toward lipids as energy source in pre-diabetes subjects. In contrast, long-term insulin treated T2DM subjects had slightly decreased mitochondrial density and ex vivo function. Expression of Krebs cycle and OXPHOS related genes were decreased, indicating a decreased capacity to use lipids as an energy source. The insulin-treated T2DM subjects had a lower physical activity level than pre-diabetic and normoglycemic subjects. A 52 weeks exercise training of these subjects increased submaximal oxidative efficiency, increased in vivo PCr recovery rate, as well as mildly increased in vitro mitochondrial function. Gene expression of ____-oxidation, Krebs cycle and OXPHOS-related genes was increased. Our data demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction is rather a consequence than a causative factor in T2DM development as it was only detected in overt diabetes and not in early diabetes. Regular exercise training stabilized exogenous insulin requirement and improved mitochondrial functioning, fatty acid oxidation and general physical work load capacity in long-standing insulin-treated T2DM subjects. As such, the present study shows for the first time that long-term exercise interventions are beneficial in this group of complex diabetes patient and may prevent further metabolic deterioration. Insulin-treated T2DM subjects before and after 52 weeks of exercise training (T2DM_0 and T2DM_52), normoglycemic controls (NGT) and pre-diabetes subjects (IGT) and were selected. RNA was extracted from skeletal muscle biopsies and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays."	"GEO"	"partial"

This laboratory is studying the glycosylation and secretion process of mucins and biological functions involving mucins. This lab is also interested in receptor modulation mediated by glycosylation or through glycosphingolipids. We have a particular interest in understanding how mucin type O-glycosylation is regulated. Mucin type O-glycosylation is controlled by the ppGalNAc-transferase multigene family. An estimated 23 iso-forms belong to this family, so the specific involvement of each individual iso-form in any given organ seems complex to understand. An initial attempt to comprehend how this multigene family regulates mucin type O-glycosylation, is to get insight into which iso-forms are expressed in different organs and cell types. For this reason we have generated monoclonal antibodies towards 7 iso-forms, and the list of ppGalNAc-T iso-form specific monoclonals is currently growing. We have done some immuno histochemistry on lung using the available monoclonals, but are keen on assessing the number of ppGalNAc-T's expressed in lung as determined this Glyco-array. We have focused on lung because a number of ppGalNAc-T acceptor polypeptides, belonging to the mucin gene family, are expressed in this organ.

To explore in vivo mucosal responses of healthy adults to probiotics, we obtained transcriptomes in an intervention study following a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design. In the mucosa of the proximal small intestine of healthy volunteers, probiotic strains from the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei and L. rhamnosus each induced differential gene regulatory networks and pathways in the human mucosa. Comprehensive analyses revealed that these transcriptional networks regulate major basal mucosal processes, and uncovered remarkable similarity to response profiles obtained for specific bioactive molecules and drugs.

Global transcriptional changes characteristic of disease and infection phenotypes were identified. Two analysis methods found large numbers of differentially regulated genes and the existence of networks of co-expressed genes. There were signatures characteristic of the host defence response with evidence supporting infiltration of various types of leukocytes and activation of innate responses of epithelial cells. Two separate methods could classify disease and infection phenotype based on transcription signatures with 70% accuracy. These results provide an insight into the complexity of the acute response in trachoma but are able to partly explain the biology of trachoma through the identification of pathways and gene expression sets useful to future studies on chlamydial immunopathogenesis. Conjunctival samples from 60 participants were tested on U133 plus 2.0 arrays (40 participants with clinical signs of active trachoma and 20 controls with normal conjunctivas as before). Samples were further sub-divided based on the detection and quantification of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis load by PCR tests. Gene expression was then assessed using differential expression and construction of co-expression networks.

Unfortunately, changes in experimental planning and execution, such as the unavailability of previously anticipated samples or a shift in research focus, may render significant numbers of pre-purchased GeneChip____ microarrays unprocessed before their manufacturer's expiration dates. Researchers and microarray core facilities wonder whether expired microarrays are still useful for gene expression analysis. Our results demonstrated that microarray data generated using U133A microarrays, which were more than four years past the manufacturer's expiration date, were highly specific and consistent with those from unexpired microarrays in identifying DEGs despite some appreciable fold change compression and decrease in sensitivity. Our data also suggested that the MAQC reference RNA samples, stored at -80 C, were stable over a time frame of at least four years. The new gene expression data were generated with 12 microarrays (2 types of microarrays x 2 samples x 3 replicates). Three replicates for each of the two MAQC samples (A = Stratagene's Universal Human Reference RNA; B = Ambion's Human Brain Reference RNA) were profiled in 2009 by using both the expired U133A microarrays (expired in 2004) and the unexpired U133Plus2 microarrays. In addition, gene expression data generated with unexpired U133Plus2 microarrays (AFX), other microarray platforms, and TaqManR assays by the MAQC project in 2005 were used as references to assess the stability of the MAQC samples stored at -80 C for four years by comparing new microarray data with those obtained four years ago.

"GSE19587"	"Imaging-guided microarray: Identifies molecular markers in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease"	"The full complement of molecular pathways contributing to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis remains unknown. Here, to address this issue, we began by using a high-resolution variant of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to pinpoint brainstem regions differentially affected by, and resistant to, the disease. Then, relying on the imaging information as a guide, we profiled gene expression levels of postmortem brain samples and used a factorial statistical model to identify a disease related decrease in the expression of the polyamine enzyme spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1). Next, a series of studies were performed to confirm the pathogenic relevance of this finding. First, to test for a causal link between polyamines and alpha-synuclein toxicity, we investigated a yeast model expressing alpha-synuclein. Polyamines were found to enhance the toxicity of alpha-synuclein, and an unbiased genome-wide screen for modifiers of alpha-synuclein toxicity identified Tpo4, a member of a family of proteins responsible for polyamine transport. Second, to test for a causal link between SAT1 activity and PD histopathology we investigated a mouse model expressing alpha-synuclein. DENSPM (N1, N11-diethylnorspermine), a polyamine analog that increases SAT1 activity, was found to reduce PD histopathology, while Berenil (diminazene aceturate), a pharmacological agent that reduces SAT1 activity, worsened the histopathology. Third, we genotyped PD patients and controls and isolated a rare but novel variant in the SAT1 gene, although the functional significance of this genetic variant was not identified. Taken together, the results suggest that the polyamine pathway contributes to PD pathogenesis. Imaging-guided microarray In principle, gene expression profiling techniques like microarray are well suited to identify molecular pathways contributing to the pathogenesis of complex diseases. In practice, however, microarray applied to diseases of the brain present a number of analytic challenges. By identifying regions within the same brain structure that are differentially targeted by and resistant to a disease, imaging-guided microarray is an approach designed to address these limitations. Specifically, guided by the spatial information generated from high resolution functional imaging, a 2x2 factorial analysis-of-variance can be designed, including both within and between group factors, and this ""double subtraction"" model is effective in improving signal-to-noise in a microarray experiment. Relying on imaging findings, we harvested the DMNV from 6 postmortem brains with evidence of PD and from 5 control brains. The postmortem PD cases were evaluated for pathological changes (Lewy body-containing neurons and Lewy neurites evidenced with antibodies directed against alpha-synuclein aggregates) that matched the pattern proposed by Braak. We relied on the imaging results to identify a neighboring medullary region relatively unaffected by the disease to be used as a within-brain control. We decided on the inferior olivary nucleus (ION), because it is histologically identifiable, and harvested the ION from each of the 6 PD cases and 5 controls. Microarray techniques were used to generate gene expression profiles for each of the 22 tissue samples. A repeated-measures 2x2 factorial ANOVA model constructed for the imaging study was applied to the expression dataset, in which expression levels from two regions of the medulla (DMNV vs. ION) were included as the first within group factor, diagnosis (PD vs. controls) was the between group factor, and age and sex were included as covariates. Based on current literature, one of the top hits (SAT1) was investigated further to determine if it played a role in PD pathogenesis."	"GEO"	"partial"

"GSE21785"	"Systematic analysis of a human renal transcript dataset"	"Glomerular diseases account for the majority of cases with chronic renal failure. Several genes have been identified with key relevance for glomerular function. Quite a few of these genes show a specific or preferential mRNA expression in the renal glomerulus. To identify additional candidate genes involved in glomerular function in humans we generated a human renal glomerulus-specific transcript dataset (GTD) by comparing gene expression profiles from human glomeruli and tubulointerstitium obtained from six transplant living donors using Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays. This analysis resulted in 677 genes with prominent overrepresentation in the glomerulus. Genes with ""a priori"" established known prominent glomerular expression served for validation and were all found in the novel expression library (e.g. CDKN1, DAG1, DDN, EHD3, MYH9, NES, NPHS1, NPHS2, PDPN, PLA2R1, PLCE1, PODXL, PTPRO, SYNPO, TCF21, TJP1, WT1). The mRNA expression for several novel glomerulus-enriched genes identified in REGGEL was validated by qRT-PCR. Gene ontology and pathway analysis identified biological processes previously not reported to be of relevance in glomeruli including among others axon guidance. This finding was further validated by assessing the expression of the axon guidance molecules neuritin (NRN1) and roundabout receptor ROBO1 and -2. Glomerular disease associated differential mRNA regulation of ROBO2 was found in diabetic nephropathy. In summary, using a comparative strategy on microdissected nephrons novel transcripts with predominant expression in the human glomerulus could be identified. A systematic analysis of this glomerulus-specifc gene expression library allows the detection of target molecules and biological processes involved in glomerular biology and renal disease. Sample from kidney biopsies of 6 transplant Living Donors (LD) were microdissected into tubular and glomerular compartment and separately hybridized an Affymetrix HG-U133A microarrays. Background correction and quantile normalization was ferformed using RMAexpress Version 0.3 as part of a dataset of 88 samples for glomeruli and 84 samples for tubuli. All data are reported in log2 scale. A background filter cut-off was defined to lower the count of false positive calls using the highest signal value obtained from non-human Affymetrix control oligonucleotides multiplied by a factor of 1.2, following previous studies: Schmid H, Boucherot A, Yasuda Y, et al.: Modular activation of nuclear factor-kappaB transcriptional programs in human diabetic nephropathy.

RNA was isolated from composite bone marrow from 25 healthy children, adolescents and adults age 2 months to 28 years. As reference transcript for precursor B cells we used recombination activating gene RAG1 exploring the data for other transcripts showing the same profile as RAG1 with age. We identified 54 genes with correlated expression profiles to RAG1 ((r ³ 0.9, p = 0), characterized by high expression at 3 - 20 months followed by a fast decline to lower signal levels maintained until early adulthood. Immunophenotyping from a similar healthy age-matched cohort (n = 37) showed a comparable decrease of precursor B cells. Of the 54 genes 15 were characteristically B cell associated representing cell surface molecules (CD19, CD72, CD79A, CD79B, CD180, IGL@, IGLL1, VPREB1, VPREB3), a signal transduction molecule (BLNK) and transcription factors (DNTT, EBF1, PAX5, POU2AF1, RAG2).

The mechanism of action is largely unknown. We obtained pubertal growth plate specimens of the same girl at Tanner stage B2 and Tanner stage B3, which allowed us to address this issue in more detail. Histological analysis showed that progression of puberty coincided with characteristic morphological changes associated with growth plate maturation, such as decreases in total growth plate height (p=0.002), height of the individual zones (p<0.001) and a increase in intercolumnar space (p<0.001). Microarray analysis of the specimens identified 394 genes (72% upregulated, 28% downregulated) changing with progression of puberty. Overall changes in gene expression were small (average 1.1 fold change). The 394 genes mapped to 13 significantly changing pathways (p<0.05) in majority belonging to extracellular matrix, cell cycle and cell death, which are all related to growth plate maturation. We next scanned the upstream promoter regions of the 394 genes for the presence of evolutionary conserved binding sites for transcription factors implemented in growth plate maturation such as Estrogen Receptor, Androgen Receptor, Elk1, Stat5b, CREBP and Runx2. Runx2 and Elk1, but not estrogen receptor binding sites were enriched and were present in 87 and 43 out of the 394 genes, respectively.In conclusion, our data suggest a role for Runx2 and Elk1 in growth plate maturation and provides suggestive evidence that the effect of estrogen on growth plate maturation is not mediated by activating genomic estrogen signalling in growth plate chondrocytes. 2 replicate samples for each developmental stage for a total of 6 samples"	"GEO"	"total"

Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-coupled microarray profiling of 17,967 promoter regions and 4,566 intergenic CpG islands was combined with genome-wide mRNA expression profiling to identify liver tissue-specific PB-mediated DNA methylation and transcriptional alterations. Only a limited number of significant anti-correlations were observed between PB-induced transcriptional and promoter-based DNA methylation perturbations. However, the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) target gene Cyp2b10 was found to be concomitantly hypomethylated and transcriptionally activated in a liver tissue-specific manner following PB treatment. Furthermore, analysis of active and repressive histone modifications using chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed a strong PB-mediated epigenetic switch at the Cyp2b10 promoter. Our data reveal that PB-induced transcriptional perturbations are not generally associated with broad changes in the DNA methylation status at proximal promoters and suggest that the drug-inducible CAR pathway regulates an epigenetic switch from repressive to active chromatin at the target gene Cyp2b10. This study demonstrates the utility of integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic profiling for elucidating early mechanisms and biomarkers of non-genotoxic carcinogenesis. 29-32 days old male B6C3F1/Crl (C57BL/6 male x C3H/He female) mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Germany). Animals were allowed to acclimatise for 5 days prior to being randomly divided into two treatment groups (n = 10) and phenobarbital (Sigma 04710, 0.05% (w/v) in drinking water) was administered to one group through ad libitum access to drinking water for 28 days. Mice were checked daily for activity and behavior and sacrificed on the last day of dosing (day 28). Blood was withdrawn for PK analysis and target (liver) and non-target (kidney) tissues removed, split into several sections, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 C for subsequent analyses. Total RNA from liver and kidney was purified and processed for Affymetrix gene expression profiling while genomic DNA was prepared for promoter array based methylome analysis using the Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) procedure. Remaining tissue material was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to analyze histone modifications at individual promoters. Plasma samples were also collected to evaluate phenobarbital exposure in individual animals by LC-MS."	"GEO"	"partial"

Zhenji Gan, Eileen Burkart-Hartman, Dong-Ho Han, Brian Finck, Teresa C. Leone, John Holloszy, and Daniel P. Kelly. To identify new gene regulatory pathways controlling skeletal muscle energy metabolism, comparative studies were conducted on muscle-specific transgenic mouse lines expressing the nuclear receptors, PPARalpha (MCK-PPARalpha) or PPARbeta/delta (MCK-PPARbeta/delta). MCK-PPARbeta/delta mice are known to have enhanced exercise performance whereas MCK-PPARalpha mice perform at low levels. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh)b/Ldha gene expression ratio is increased in MCK-PPARbeta/delta muscle, an isoenzyme shift that diverts pyruvate into the mitochondrion for the final steps of glucose oxidation. PPARbeta/delta gain- and loss-of-function studies in skeletal myotubes demonstrated that PPARbeta/delta, but not PPARalpha, interacts with the exercise inducible kinase, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), to synergistically activate Ldhb gene transcription by cooperating with myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A), in a PPARbeta/delta ligand-independent manner. MCK-PPARbeta/delta muscle was shown to have high glycogen stores, increased levels of GLUT4, and augmented capacity for mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation suggesting a broad reprogramming of glucose utilization pathways. Lastly, exercise studies demonstrated that MCK-PPARbeta/delta mice had lower circulating levels of lactate compared to non-transgenic controls, while exhibiting supranormal performance on a high intensity exercise regimen. These results identify a transcriptional regulatory mechanism that increases capacity for muscle glucose utilization in a pattern that resembles the effects of exercise training. Keywords: muscle, exercise, nuclear receptors, glucose metabolism, gene regulation RNA from two wild-type (non-transgenic (NTG)) and two PPARbeta overexpressing (MCK-PPARb) mice was analyzed.

Furthermore, the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) genotype is suggested to exert a modulating effect on the association between early life stress and the risk for depression. In the present study, we use a 5-HTT x PS paradigm to investigate whether the effects of PS are dependent upon the 5-HTT genotype. Methods: The effects of PS on cognition, anxiety- and depression-related behaviour were examined using a maternal restraint stress paradigm of PS in C57BL6 wild-type (WT) and heterozygous (+/-) 5-HTT knockout mice. Additionally, in the female offspring, a genome-wide hippocampal gene expression screening was performed. Results: 5-HTT +/- offspring showed enhanced memory performance and signs of reduced anxiety as compared to WT offspring. Conversely, exposure of 5-HTT +/- mice to PS was associated with altered stress-responsivity and increased depressive-like behaviour, particularly in female offspring. Further, 5-HTT genotype, PS and their interaction differentially affected the expression of numerous genes and related pathways within the female hippocampus. Specifically, MAPK and neurotrophin signalling were regulated by both the 5-HTT +/- genotype and PS exposure, whereas cytokine and Wnt signalling were affected in a 5-HTT genotype x PS manner, indicating a gene x environment interaction at the molecular level. Conclusions: The long-term behavioural effects of PS in C57BL6 mice are partly dependent on the 5-HTT genotype. Further, hippocampal gene expression profiles suggest that distinct molecular mechanisms mediate the behavioural effects of the 5-HTT genotype, PS exposure, and their interaction. total samples analysed are 12"	"GEO"	"partial"		
"GSE34305"	"brain expression data from adult mice prenatally exposed to ethanol"	"Moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy can result in a heterogeneous range of neurobehavioural and cognitive effects, termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). We have developed a mouse moder of FASD that involves moderate ethanol exposure throughout gestation achieved by voluntary maternal consumption. This model results in phenotypes relevant to FASD. Since ethanol is known to directly affect the expression of genes in the developing brain leading to abnormal cell death, changes to cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, and potential changes to epigenetic patterning, we hypothesize that this leaves a long-term footprint on the adult brain. However, the long-term effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on brain gene expression, when behavioural phenotypes are apparent, are unclear. We used two independent microarray experiments and focused on the genes identified by both to evaluate the genome-wide alterations to the adult brain transcriptome caused by prenatal ethanol exposure via moderate maternal drinking. To generate samples, two independent groups of female C57BL/6J mice were given access to 10% ethanol in water or water only. Control females had access to water only. Females were mated and continued to drink from gestational day 0 to pup postnatal day 10. Whole brain RNA from adult (postnatal day 70) male ethanol-exposed offspring was extracted. For experiment 1, RNA samples from three mice were pooled to reduce litter effects and the pooled samples were hybridized on Affymetrix arrays (2 control and 2 ethanol chips, total n=12 mice).

Disturbances in RET signaling are associated with ENS defects, as is seen in patients with Hirschsprung disease. However, the downstream effectors of RET signalling in ENCCs is largely unknown. This study aims to gain new insight into the pathways involved in or triggered by RET in ENCCs. We used microarrays to detect the gene expression of mouse embryonic ENCCs when we stimulated with GDNF compare to control without GDNF and also compare to the gene expression of mouse embryonic gut (all are isolated from mouse embryonic day 14.5). Our aim is to gain insight of RET-GDNF downstream effectors and also all signalling pathways that regulate by RET-GDNF in ENCCs during development. We performed gene expression profiling with RNA isolated from GDNF- (the RET ligand) stimulated and non-stimulated mouse ENCCs and also from mouse embryonic gut E14.5. We compare these three set of microarray data to each other and analyzed single-gene analysis methods. by this analysis we could detect genes that regulate by RET-GDNF signalling in ENCCs and by comparing data of ENCCs with and without GDNF to the expression data of mouse embryonic gut in the same stage of development, we could also detect gene that specifically express in ENCCs dependent and independently of RET-GDNF signalling. We analyzed the gene expression data of ENCCs with and without GDNF by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to detect which pathways are down- and up-regulated by RET-GDNF signalling."

An emerging model of interdependence between neural and vascular systems includes VEGF, with its dual roles as a potent angiogenesis factor and neural regulator. Although a number of studies have implicated VEGF in CNS development, little is known about the role that the different VEGF isoforms play in early neurogenesis. We used a mouse model of disrupted VEGF isoform expression that eliminates the predominant brain isoform, VEGF164, and expresses only the diffusible form, VEGF120. We tested the hypothesis that VEGF164 plays a key role in controlling neural precursor populations in developing cortex. We used microarray analysis to compare gene expression differences between wild type and VEGF120 mice at E9.5, the primitive stem cell stage of the neuroepithelium. We quantified changes in PHH3-positive nuclei, neural stem cell markers (Pax6 and nestin) and the Tbr2-positive intermediate progenitors at E11.5 when the neural precursor population is expanding rapidly. Absence of VEGF164 (and VEGF188) leads to reduced proliferation without an apparent effect on the number of Tbr2-positive cells. There is a corresponding reduction in the number of mitotic spindles that are oriented parallel to the ventricular surface relative to those with a vertical or oblique angle. These results support a role for the VEGF isoforms in supporting the neural precursor population of the early neuroepithelium.

We have previously generated the Deletor mice to model late-onset progressive RC defects. Here we report novel tissue-specific pathways contributing to mitochondrial disease pathogenesis, identified by gene expression analysis. We found that RC-deficient muscle fibers secrete the fasting-induced hormone, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). This response leads to fatty acid recruitment from adipocytes and resistance to high-fat-diet induced obesity in mice, but does not affect glucose or insulin metabolism. FGF21 is also induced in the muscle of mitochondrial myopathy patients and in other RC-deficient mice. These data show that skeletal muscle is an endocrine organ, which signals its energy deficiency through FGF21. Furthermore, RC deficiency in single muscle fibers initiates a global starvation response. These data have important implications for conditions with primary or secondary RC deficiency. Mice overexpressing mutant Twinkle (C10ORF2) protein are the first animal model for Progressive External Ophtalmoplegia (PEO).

The transcriptional repressor Cic binds directly to Atxn1 and plays a key role in SCA1 pathogenesis. Two isoforms of Cic, long (Cic-L) and short (Cic-S), are transcribed from alternative promoters. Using embryonic stem cells in which the Cic locus was targeted by an insertion of a genetrap cassette between exon 1 of the Cic-L isoform and exon 1 of the Cic-S isoform, we generated mice that carried this allele and backcrossed these onto a Swiss Webster (CD-1) strain for >6 generations.

However, impacts of adaptive immune reactions on clinically apparent atherosclerosis such as intima lesion (plaque) rupture, thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and aneurysm largely remain to be identified. It is increasingly recognized that leukocyte infiltrates in plaque, media, and adventitia are distinct but their specific roles have not been defined. To map these infiltrates, we employed laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate the three arterial wall laminae using apoE-/- mouse aorta as a model. RNA from LCM-separated tissues was extracted and large scale whole genome expression microarrays were prepared. We observed that the quality of the resulting gene expression maps was compromised by tissue RNA carried over from adjacent laminae during LCM. To account for these flaws, we established quality controls and algorithms to improve the predictive power of LCM-derived microarray data. Our approach creates robust transcriptome atlases of normal and atherosclerotic aorta. Assessing LCM transcriptomes for immunity-related mRNAs indicated markedly distinctive gene expression patterns in the three laminae of the atherosclerotic aorta. These mouse mRNA expression data banks can now be mined to address a wide range of questions in cardiovascular biology. Wild-type and apoE-deficient mice on the C57BL/6J genetic background were maintained on a standard mouse chow.

"GSE25908"	"Distinct Protein Degradation Induced by Different Disuse Models of Skeletal Muscle Atrophy"	"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a consequence of many diseases, environmental insults, inactivity, age and injury. Atrophy is characterized by active degradation and removal of contractile proteins and a reduction in fiber size. Animal models have been extensively used to identify pathways leading to atrophic conditions. Here we have used genome-wide expression profiling analysis and quantitative PCR to identify the molecular changes that occur in two clinically relevant animal mouse models of muscle atrophy, hindlimb casting and Achilles tendon laceration (tenotomy). Gastrocnemius muscle samples were collected 2, 7 and 14 days after insult. The total amount of muscle loss as measured by wet weight and muscle fiber size was equivalent between models, although tenotomy resulted in a more rapid induction of muscle atrophy. Furthermore, tentomy resulted in the regulation of significantly more mRNA transcripts then casting. Analysis of the regulated genes and pathways suggest that the mechanism of atrophy is distinct between these models. The degradation following casting appears ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated while degradation following tenotomy appears lysosomal and matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-mediated. This data suggests that there are multiple mechanisms leading to muscle atrophy and that specific therapeutic agents may be necessary to combat the atrophy seen under different conditions. Muscle atrophy was induced through two methods; unloading induced by tendon laceration (Tenotomy) and immobilization induced by hindlimb casting (Casting). For the tenotomy, eight week old male C57/B6 mice were anesthetized by ether inhalation and subsequent intramuscular injection of ketamine-xylazine (0.1 ml/g). The right Achilles tendon just proximal to the calcaneus was severed with a sterile scalpel. The mice were allowed to recover and move freely about their cage. An additional cohort of animals was sham operated (Sham) which involved isolation and manipulation of the Achilles tendon without laceration. For the casting, the right hindlimbs of eight week old male C57Bl/6 mice were immobilized through casting. After 2, 7 or 14 days, animals were sacrificed and the left and right gastrocnemius muscles were carefully removed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 C for further processing.

We first show that Tenascin-C is expressed by gliogenic neural precursor cells during late embryonic development. The loss of Tenascin-C leads to a sustained generation and delayed migration of Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 expressing immature astrocytes in vivo. Furthermore, we could demonstrate an upregulation of Nk2 transcription factor related locus 2 (Nkx2.2) and its downstream target Sulfatase 1 in vivo. A dorsal expansion of Nkx2.2-positive cells within the ventral spinal cord indicates a potential progenitor cell domain shift. Moreover, Sulfatase 1 is known to regulate growth factor signalling by cleaving sulphate residues from heparan sulphate proteoglycans. Consistent with this possibility we observed changes in both Fibroblast growth factor 2 and Epidermal growth factor responsiveness of spinal cord neural precursor cells.

"GSE28025"	"Comparative gene expression analysis of repro9/repro9 and wild type testes from 14 and 17 day mice"	"Repro9 in an allele of Mybl1 (A-Myb) transcription factor obtained in ENU screen to identify alleles causing mouse infertility. Repro9/repro9 mutant males are infertile due to meiotic arrest at pachytene stage. Mutants show wide range of abnormalities including inefficient chromosome synapsis, sex body formation and progression through meiotic cycle. Females are unaffected. To determine genes transcriptionally regulated by MYBL1 we analyzed gene expression profiles of wild type and repro9/repro9 mutant testis at 14 and 17 days postpartum. Analysis revealed many misregulated genes, in majority downregulated, at day 14 pp and even more at day 17 pp, probably due to secondary effects of meiotic arrest. Significantly misregulated genes were characterized by Gene Ontology. Comparative gene expression analysis uncovered potential targets of MYBL1 regulation that play roles in regulation of transcription, cell cycle, apoptosis, protein phosphorylation and ubiquitination, chromosome organization and others. Abstract:The transcriptional regulation of mammalian meiosis is poorly characterized, due to few genetic and ex vivo models. From a genetic screen, we identify the transcription factor MYBL1 as a male-specific master regulator of several critical meiotic processes. Spermatocytes bearing a novel separation-of-function allele (Mybl1repro9) had subtle defects in autosome synapsis in pachynema, a high incidence of unsynapsed sex chromosomes, incomplete double strand break (DSB) repair on synapsed pachytene chromosomes, and a lack of crossing-over. MYBL1 protein appears in pachynema, and its mutation caused specific alterations in expression of diverse genes, including some translated postmeiotically. These data, coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) experiments and bioinformatic analysis of promoters, identified direct targets of MYBL1 regulation. Meiosis in mutant females appears unaffected. These results reveal that MYBL1 is a master regulator of meiotic genes that are involved in multiple processes in spermatocytes, including chromosome synapsis, recombination, and cell cycle progression through pachynema. RNA was extracted from wt and repro9/repro9 mutant testis from 14 and 17 days old mice. This two time points were selected for sample enrichment in early/midpachytene and latepachytene/diplotene spermatocytes, respectively. Total testis RNA from wild-type (³3) and mutant (³3) mice was reverse-transcribed into double stranded cDNA, and biotin-labeled cRNA (GeneChip IVT labeling kit, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was hybridized to Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 GeneChips containing.

"GSE25095"	"Protective Role of IL-10 in Ozone-induced Pulmonary Inflammation"	"Background: The mechanisms underlying ozone (O3)-induced pulmonary inflammation remain unclear. Interleukin (IL)-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that is known to inhibit inflammatory mediators. Objectives: The current study investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying IL-10-mediated attenuation of O3-induced pulmonary inflammation in mice. Methods: Il10-deficient (Il10-/-) and wild type (Il10+/+) mice were exposed to 0.3-ppm O3 or filtered air for 24, 48 or 72 hr. Immediately following exposure, differential cell counts, and total protein (a marker of lung permeability) were assessed from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). mRNA and protein levels of cellular mediators were determined from lung homogenates. We also utilized global mRNA expression analyses of lung tissue with Ingenuity Pathway Analyses (IPA) to identify patterns of gene expression through which IL-10 modifies O3-induced inflammation. Results: Mean numbers of BALF polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were significantly greater in Il10-/- mice than in Il10+/+ mice after exposure to O3 at all time points tested. O3-enhanced nuclear NF-kB translocation was elevated in the lungs of Il10-/- compared to Il10+/+ mice. Gene expression analyses revealed several key IL-10 and O3-dependent mediators, including IL-6, MIP-2, IL-1 and CD86. Conclusions: Results indicated that IL-10 protects against O3-induced pulmonary neutrophilic inflammation and cell proliferation. Moreover, gene expression analyses identified three response pathways and several novel genetic targets (e.g. Ccr1, Socs3, Il33, Hat1, and Gale) through which IL10 may modulate the innate and adaptive immune response. These novel mechanisms of protection against the pathogenesis of O3-induced pulmonary inflammation may also provide potential therapeutic targets to protect susceptible individuals.

"E-MEXP-2944"	"cRel sang"	"NF-kB is a transcriptional factor that consists in homo and heterodimers of the large family of Rel subunits. Among the most important functions for NF-kB, initiation of immunological/inflammatory responses and regulation of cell proliferation/apoptosis which are the major features of severe infections. Although the role of NF-kB is crucial in host defense against pathogens, mice deficient for individual subunits of NF-kB have not been explored in murine models of polymicrobial infection. In this report, we have investigated in vivo the consequences of cRel subunit deficiency in the survival to polymicrobial infection. We have also approached the underlying mechanisms of the host defense by analyzing cytokine production, bacterial clearance and the distribution of innate and adaptive immune cells. Absence of cRel enhances mice mortality to polymicrobial sepsis. The decreased survival of cRel-/- animals upon infection is not related to altered local mechanisms of innate defense such as the peritoneal recruitment of the Gr.1+CD11b+ phagocytic cells and the bacterial clearance. However, cRel deficiency allows to altered systemic cytokine response associated to sustained loss of the lymphoid subset CD8a+ of spleen dendritic cells, key antigen-presenting cells for the initiation of the adaptive immunity. Genome-wide analysis of the systemic host response to polymicrobial sepsis reveals inflammatory/immune and apoptotic gene signatures associated to cRel subunit. In this study we identified the NF-kB member cRel, as a key factor which plays a critical role in survival to polymicrobial sepsis and also as a regulatory transcription subunit controlling the inflammatory and the adaptive immune responses in severe infection."

To gain insight into underlying mechanisms, we carried out a comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis of the effect of 2 week treatment withfenofibrate and fish oil in mice. Plasma triglycerides were significantly decreased byfenofibrate (-49.1%) and fish oil (-21.8%), whereas plasma cholesterol was increased by fenofibrate (+29.9%) and decreased by fish oil (-32.8%). Levels of various phospholipid species were specifically decreased by fish oil, while levels of Krebs cycle intermediates were increased specifically by fenofibrate. Plasma levels of many amino acids were altered by fenofibrate and to a lesser extent by fish oil. Both fenofibrate and fish oil upregulated genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, and downregulated genes involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis. Significant overlap in gene regulation by fenofibrate and fish oil was observed, reflecting their property as high or low affinity agonist for PPAR____, respectively. Fenofibrate specifically downregulated genes involved in complement cascade and inflammatory response. Fish oil specifically downregulated genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, and upregulated genes involved in amino acid and arachidonic acid metabolism. Taken together, the data indicate that despite being similarly potent towards modulating plasma free fatty acids, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, fish oil causes modest changes in gene expression likely via activation of multiple mechanistic pathways, whereas fenofibrate causes pronounced gene expression changes via a single pathway, reflecting the key difference between nutritional and pharmacological intervention.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of preconditioning, we compared brain and blood genomic profiles in response to preconditioning with these TLR ligands and to preconditioning via exposure to brief ischemia. The experiment is a comparison of multiple treatment groups with sampling at multiple time points. The objective is to identify differentially regulated genes associated with preconditioning.

In particular, deletion of 16p11.2 is found in patients with autism, developmental delay, and obesity. Patients with deletions or duplications have a wide range of clinical features, and siblings carrying the same deletion often have diverse symptoms. To study the consequence of 16p11.2 CNVs in a systematic manner, we used chromosome engineering to generate mice harboring deletion of the chromosomal region corresponding to 16p11.2, as well as mice harboring the reciprocal duplication. These 16p11.2 CNV models have dosage-dependent changes in gene expression, viability, brain architecture, and behavior. For each phenotype, the consequence of the deletion is more severe than that of the duplication. Of particular note is that half of the 16p11.2 deletion mice die postnatally; those that survive to adulthood are healthy and fertile, but have alterations in the hypothalamus and exhibit a ""behavior trap"" phenotype -a specific behavior characteristic of rodents with lateral hypothalamic and nigrostriatal lesions. Our findings indicate that 16p11.2 CNVs cause both brain and behavioral anomalies, providing new insight into human neurodevelopmental disorders. We analyzed gene expression profiles in the brain and determined whether expression corresponded with gene dosage. We measured mRNA intensities in 37 microarray hybridizations representing four brain regions (olfactory bulbs, cortex, cerebellum and brain stem; 5 samples were hybridized twice for estimation of technical errors) in two df/+ mice heterozyous for the deletion of the chromosomal region syntenic to human 16p11.2, three +/+ (wild type) mice and three dp/+ mice heterozyous for the duplication of the chromosomal region syntenic to human 16p11.2.

ERRGO mice show increased expression of genes promoting fat metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and type I fiber specification. In parallel, the type II muscle in ERRGO mice display an activated angiogenic program marked by myofibrillar induction and secretion of pro-angiogenic factors, frank neo-vascularization and a 100% increase in running endurance. Surprisingly, the induction of VEGF and type I muscle properties by ERRg does not involve the transcriptional co-activator PGC1a. Instead, ERRg genetically activates the energy sensor AMPK which is typically inactive in absence of exercise. Therefore, ERRg and AMPK, known regulators of mitochondrial function and metabolism, together control a novel angiogenic pathway that anatomically synchronizes vascular arborization to oxidative metabolism revealing an exercise-independent mechanism for matching supply and demand.

"GSE32102"	"Arsenate Sub-chronic Drinking Water Study"	"Concentration- and time-dependent genomic changes in the mouse urinary bladder following exposure to arsenate in drinking water for up to twelve weeks. Inorganic arsenic (Asi) is a known human bladder carcinogen. The objective of this study was to examine the concentration dependence of the genomic response to Asi in the urinary bladders of mice. C57BL/6J mice were exposed for 1 or 12 weeks to arsenate in drinking water at concentrations of 0.5, 2, 10, and 50 mg As/L. Urinary bladders were analyzed using gene expression microarrays. A consistent reversal was observed in the direction of gene expression change: from predominantly decreased expression at 1 week to predominantly increased expression at 12 weeks. These results are consistent with evidence from in vitro studies of an acute adaptive response that is suppressed on longer exposure due to down-regulation of Fos. Pathways with the highest enrichment in gene expression changes were associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inflammation, and proliferation. Benchmark dose (BMD) analysis determined that the lowest median BMD values for pathways were above 5 mg As/L, despite the fact that pathway enrichment was observed at the 0.5 mg As/L exposure concentration. This disparity may result from the non-monotonic nature of the concentration-responses for the expression changes of a number of genes, as evidenced by the much fewer gene expression changes at 2 mg As/L compared to lower or higher concentrations. Pathway categories with concentration-related gene expression changes included cellular morphogenesis, inflammation, apoptosis/survival, cell cycle control, and DNA damage response. The results of this study provide evidence of a concentration-dependent transition in the mode of action for the subchronic effects of Asi in mouse bladder cells in the vicinity of 2 mg Asi/L.

"GSE31990"	"To study glycobiology-related abnormalities in retinal degeneration, an area that is relatively unexplored"	"Retinal degeneration is the leading cause of irreversible blindness. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a genetically heterogenous group of diseases. In the United States, approximately one in 4000 individuals is affected. RP begins with the loss of night vision due to the loss of rod photoreceptor cells. The disease progresses slowly with the loss of peripheral vision, and eventually leads to complete debilitating and irreversible blindness. The first mutation associated with human RP was identified in the gene encoding rhodopsin, the G-protein coupled receptor of rod photoreceptor cells. Mutations within the rhodopsin gene account for significant portion of RP cases. Specifically, mutations of the proline at residue 347 in rhodopsin have been linked to human RP. We are fortunate to have access to the P347S rhodopsin mutant mice. These mice represent an excellent transgenic mouse model of retinal degeneration. The P347S rhodopsin mutation is one of the best studied mutations, yet the mechanism by which the mutation causes degeneration is still unknown. One study has demonstrated that galectin-1 plays a role in degeneration of neuronal processes (1) and another study has shown that expression level of galectin-3 is elevated in retinas of patients with age-related macular degeneration. These studies in conjunction with the availibility of the P347S mutant mice have provided impetus to examine the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration in the context of the possible role of glycans and glycan-binding proteins. The time course of photoreceptor degeneration in the P347S mouse model has been carefully studied. In these mice, degeneration is barely detectable at 1 month of age, yet biochemical evidence suggests that the rod photoreceptor cells have already begun to die. At 4 months of age, approximately half of the rod photoreceptor cells have degenerated. To distinguish involvement of glycogens at the various stages of retinal degeneration, we have collected retinas of wild type and the mutant mice at four time points (1, 2, 3, and 4 months of age). This will allow us to identify the genes that target early, mid- and late stages of the retinal degeneration process.

"GSE31850"	"Genome-wide activity-dependent MeCP2 phosphorylation regulates nervous system development and function [visual cortex]"	"Autism spectrum disorders such as Rett syndrome (RTT) have been hypothesized to arise from defects in experience-dependent synapse maturation. RTT is caused by mutations in MECP2, a nuclear protein that becomes phosphorylated at S421 in response to neuronal activation. We show here that disruption of MeCP2 S421 phosphorylation in vivo results in defects in synapse development and behavior, implicating activity-dependent regulation of MeCP2 in brain development and RTT. We investigated the mechanism by which S421 phosphorylation regulates MeCP2 function and show by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing that this modification occurs on MeCP2 bound across the genome. The phosphorylation of MeCP2 S421 appears not to regulate the expression of specific genes; rather, MeCP2 functions as a histone-like factor whose phosphorylation may facilitate a genome-wide response of chromatin to neuronal activity during nervous system development. We propose that RTT results in part from a loss of this experience-dependent chromatin remodeling. Gene expression analysis of RNA isolated from P17 mouse visual cortex was performed comparing global gene expression between Wild-Type and MeCP2 S421A knock-in mice. We isolated RNA from the visual cortex of 4 wild-type and 4 MeCP2 S421A littermate P17 Mice, and analyzed mRNA expression using the Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST microarray platform."

"GSE31924"	"To study the relationship between 5-HT7 gene expressions and the expression of the glycan binding protein NCAM"	"Adult Neurogenesis and Gene Expression Changes in 5-HT7 Receptor Knockout Mice: In the adult, the formation of new nerve cells in the CNS is restricted to the subependymal layer and to the subgranular zone of the hippocampus (Duman et al., 2001). Clinically adult neurogenesis has received most attention for its possible role in major depression. Depressed patients have reduced hippocampal neurogenesis (Kasper & McEwen, 2008) and hippocampal volume (Colla et al., 2007). It has also been shown that chronic, but not acute, treatment with currently widely used antidepressants, most notably fluoxetine, results in increased hippocampal neurogenesis (Malberg et al., 2000; Miller et al., 2007). Pharmacologically antidepressants act by elevating the amount of synaptic serotonin (5-HT) and they do that within minutes of administration, but the clinical effect is often delayed, sometimes for weeks (Miller et al., 2007). This delay is believed to involve changes in plasticity and neurogenesis. With currently available treatment options for depression 20% or more of patients do not respond to the therapy. Thus, there is a need for an increased understanding of the mechanism behind plasticity and neurogenesis, and for the development of improved therapies for depression. We have in an ongoing project with the aim to functionally characterize the 5-HT7 receptor, one of the most recently discovered receptor subtypes for 5-HT (Lovenberg et al., 1993). Interestingly, we have found that this receptor might be a new target for the treatment of depression. Inactivation or pharmacological blockade of this receptor induces an antidepressant-like profile in several preclinical models of depression (Hedlund et al., 2005; Guscott et al., 2005; Wesolowska et al., 2006a, 2006b) and in sleep patterns (Thomas et al., 2003; Hedlund et al., 2005). Of special interest is also the finding that inhibition of the 5-HT7 receptor potentiates the effect of antidepressants in behavioral models of depression (Wesolowska et al., 2007; Bonaventure et al., 2007). We have recently determined that mice lacking lacking the 5-HT7 receptor show a 25% decrease in the number of proliferating cells in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus compared to wildtype mice. The mice were treated with BrdU, a thymidine analog that is incorporated into the DNA of cells undergoing mitosis. BrdU was then detected immunohistochemically. Both wildtype and knockout mice responded to fluoxetine treatment with an increase in the number of dividing cells. The reduction in the number of dividing cells in the 5-HT7 receptor knockout mice seemingly contradicts the antidepressant-like profile previously observed in these mice, but might on the other hand help to explain previously observed impairments in hippocampus-dependent learning seen in the knockout mice (Roberts et al., 2004) and after pharmacological blockade (Meneses, 2004). The observation that 5-HT7 receptors influence neurogenesis constitutes an entirely new regulatory mechanism for this physiologically and pathophysiologically important process. In order to further understand hippocampal neurogenesis and how it is influenced by 5-HT in general and 5-HT7 receptors in particular we propose to perform a microarray study using the glycogene array designed by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics using total RNA from the hippocampus. A comparison will be made between young adult male mice lacking the 5-HT7 receptor and wildtype sibling controls. Such a study should yield new valuable insights into the pathways regulating neurogenesis. The glycogene array is of particular interest as it includes several genes that have been shown to be either directly or indirectly involved in adult neurogenesis and to be regulated by 5-HT and antidepressants. Of particular interest are cell adhesion molecules which are glycoproteins. One such molecule is NCAM, a marker for immature neurons undergoing remodeling and plasticity (Nakagawa et al., 2002), which is upregulated by fluoxetine treatment (Varea et al., 2006). In contrast, NCAM is downregulated following 5-HT depletion (Brezun & Daszuta, 1999). Chronic fluoxetine treatment has also been shown to upregulate neuropeptide Y, Galectin I, Activin A receptor and Inhibin beta-A, all included in the glycogene array (Miller et al., 2007). Another relevant gene on the glycogene chip is ST8SiaIV (Nakagawa et al., 2002). Experimental Design: The hippocampus will be dissected and total RNA will be extracted according to recommended protocols for array studies. RNA from a sufficient number (2-3 animals) of male 5-HT7 receptor knockout mice will be pooled for each of the three replicates. Control samples will be similarly generated from wildtype siblings. The 5-HT7 receptor mice are on a genetically homogeneous background (backcrossed for 16 generation on a C57BL6/J background) so inter-animal variability should be negligible. The RNA will be analyzed on the glycogene array. 3 KO replicates + 3 WT replicates per glycogene array = 6 arrays"	"GEO"	"partial"		
"GSE28664"	"Akt1 is critical in Maintaining the Blood-Testis Barrier Following Exposure to the Neonatal Goitrogen, 6-N-Propylthiouracil (PTU)"	"Akt1 plays a protective role in the postnatal C57BL6 mouse testis following lactational exposure to the neonatal goitrogen, propylthiouracil (PTU). To elucidate the transcriptional profile mediating this phenotypic effect, we monitored changes in testicular gene expression at postnatal days (PNDs) 15 and 25 in Akt1+/+, Akt1+/-, and Akt1-/- testes following exposure to 0.01% PTU allowing us to determine changes in gene expression due to 1.) genotype effects; 2.) exposure effects; and 3.) genotype-by-exposure interactions. Early PTU-dependent gene changes included genes involved in lipid metabolism, spermatid differentiation, meiosis and adhesion. Early Akt1-dependent effects were associated with germ cell development, spermatid development and differentiation, and sperm motility. By PND25, the Akt1 gene-environment interaction had pronounced effects on genes associated with Sertoli cell (SC) differentiation and claudin-associated junctional formation suggesting delayed formation of the blood-testis barrier (BTB). To confirm these observations, biotin tracer experiments demonstrated a permeable blood-testis barrier in PTU-exposed PKBalpha/Akt1-/- tubules as late as PND25 compared to PTU-exposed Akt1+/+ seminiferous tubules. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated altered SC morphology, aberrant SC localization, and disorganized actin bundle formation. Taken together, loss of Akt1 coupled with postnatal exposure to the neonatal goitrogen, PTU, in the testis contributes to a transcriptional profile associated with impaired integrity of the blood-testis barrier. In summary, the Akt1-/- mouse represents a potentially important model to study BTB formation and reassembly in response to male reproductive toxicants and the various signaling networks which mediate these responses. The microarray analysis employed a balanced factorial design, with one chip created for each of three mice under each experimental condition: mouse genotype (Akt1+/+, Akt1+/-, and Akt1-/-), exposure (PTU and Control), and age (sacrificed at PND15 and 25), with a total of 36 mice and 36 chips. MoGene 1.0 st v1 arrays were used for the samples from PND 15 and Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays were used for the samples from PND 25.

Male mice were kept in polycarbonate cages on a 12-hour light/dark cycle (lights on at 0700h) with access to food and water ad libitum. Following one week of habituation, mice were randomized to either control or treatment group (n=12 male mice per strain per treatment group). Mean water intake for each strain was determined previously by measuring daily water consumption for three weeks (n=12 mice per strain). This information, along with average weight measurements for each strain, was used to determine the amount of fluoxetine required to provide a daily oral dose of 0 or 18 mg/kg per mouse. After chronic administration of 0 or 18 mg/kg of fluoxetine for 21 days, mice aged 9-10 weeks were tested in a tail-suspension and open field apparatus. Upon completion of the study, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and decapitation between 0900h and 1300h. Trunk blood was quickly collected and allowed to clot on ice. Following centrifugation, serum samples were collected and stored at -20C for determination of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine levels using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

"GSE28440"	"Gene expression from mouse white, brown, and perivascular adipose tissue"	"Thoracic perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is a unique adipose depot that likely influences vascular function and susceptibility to pathogenesis in obesity and metabolic syndrome. Surprisingly, PVAT has been reported to share characteristics of both brown and white adipose, but a detailed direct comparison to interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) has not been performed. Here we show by full genome DNA microarray analysis that global gene expression profiles of PVAT are virtually identical to BAT, with equally high expression of Ucp-1, Cidea and other genes known to be uniquely or very highly expressed in BAT. PVAT and BAT also displayed nearly identical phenotypes upon immunohistochemical analysis, and electron microscopy confirmed that PVAT contained multilocular lipid droplets and abundant mitochondria. Compared to white adipose tissue (WAT), PVAT and BAT from C57BL/6 mice fed a high fat diet for 13 weeks had markedly lower expression of immune cell-enriched mRNAs, suggesting resistance to obesity-induced inflammation. Indeed, staining of BAT and PVAT for macrophage markers (F4/80, CD68) in obese mice showed virtually no macrophage infiltration, and FACS analysis of BAT confirmed the presence of very few CD11b+/CD11c+ macrophages in BAT (1.0%) in comparison to WAT (31%). In summary, murine PVAT from the thoracic aorta is virtually identical to interscapular BAT, is resistant to diet-induced macrophage infiltration, and thus may play an important role in protecting the vascular bed from thermal and inflammatory stress. 8-week-old male C57BL6/J mice were fed a normal (ND) or high fat diet (HFD) (Research Diets 12451, 45 kcal% fat) for 13 weeks.

"GSE9038"	"Gene expression profiles of striatum and cerebellum from knock-in mouse model of Huntington's disease"	"Huntington's disease (HD) involves marked early neurodegeneration in the striatum whereas the cerebellum is relatively spared despite the ubiquitous expression of full-length mutant huntingtin, implying that inherent tissue-specific differences determine susceptibility to the HD CAG mutation. To understand this tissue specificity, we compared early mutant huntingtin-induced gene expression changes in striatum to those in cerebellum in young Hdh CAG knock-in mice, prior to onset of evident pathological alterations. Endogenous levels of full-length mutant huntingtin caused qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different gene expression changes in the two brain regions. Importantly, the quantitatively different responses in striatum and cerebellum in mutant mice were well accounted for by the intrinsic molecular differences in gene expression between striatum and cerebellum in wild-type animals. Tissue-specific gene expression changes in response to the HD mutation, therefore, appear to reflect the different inherent capacities of these tissues to buffer qualitatively similar effects of mutant huntingtin. These findings highlight a role for intrinsic quantitative tissue differences in contributing to HD pathogenesis, and likely to other neurodegenerative disorders exhibiting tissue-specificity, thereby guiding the search for effective therapeutic interventions. Total RNA was isolated from striatum and cerebellum of Hdh CAG knock-in mice (HdhQ111/HdhQ111) and wild-type mice (Hdh+/Hdh+, 3~10 weeks) for gene expression profiling using Affymetrix MG430 2.0 arrays."

This genetic setting initially triggers a growth suppressive response via p53 and the Phlpp2 ortholog, and reveals spontaneous Trp53 inactivation as a condition for full-blown disease. Surprisingly, the co-deletion of PTEN and PHLPP1 in patient samples is highly restricted to metastatic disease and tightly correlated to deletion of TP53 and PHLPP2.

"GSE31199"	"Down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in forebrains of ERCC1-deficient mice"	"Background: Several genetic defects of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, including deficiency of the Excision Repair Cross-Complementing rodent repair deficiency, complementation group 1 (ERCC1), result in pre-mature aging, impaired growth, microcephaly and delayed development of the cerebellum. Such a phenotype also occurs in ERCC1-knockout mice which survive for up to 4 weeks after birth. Therefore, we analyzed cerebellar and hippocamapal transcriptomes of these animals at 3 weeks of age to identify the candidate mechanisms underlying brain consequences of reduced ERCC1 activity. Results: In the cerebellum, the most prominent change was upregulation of genes that are associated with gliosis. Although Purkinje cell degeneration has been reported in some mouse strains with NER impairment, Purkinje cell transcriptome was mostly unaffected by the ERCC1 knockout. In the hippocampus, the gliosis response was minimal. Instead, there was an extensive downregulation of genes related to lipid metabolism including several enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as well as lipoproteins and plasma membrane proteins. Reduced expression of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway genes was also present in the neocortex of adult mice whose ERCC1 gene was replaced by a mutant allele with a partial activity. Conclusions: Downregulation of forebrain cholesterol biosynthesis genes is a newly identified consequence of ERCC1 deficiency. Its presence in adult mice suggests that it is not a secondary consequence of brain growth impairment. Instead, reduced cholesterol biosynthesis may contribute to such an impairment as well as affect function of mature synapses.

"To identify in vivo new cardiac SRF target genes and to study the response of these novel genes to SRF overexpression, we employed a cardiac-specific, transgenic mouse model that has a phenotype in young adulthood which resembles that of the typically aged heart. Using this ""cardiac aging"" model, we identified 207 genes that are important to cardiac function that were differentially expressed in vivo. Among them, 192 genes had SRF binding motifs (56 with CArG and 136 with CArG-like elements) in their promoter region. Fifty-one of 56 genes with classic CArG elements were not previously reported. These SRF target genes were grouped into 12 categories based on their function. It was observed that genes associated with cardiac energy metabolism shifted toward that of carbohydrate metabolism and away from that of fatty acid metabolism. The expression of genes that are involved in transcription and ion regulation were decreased, but expression of cytoskeletal genes were significantly increased. Using public databases of mouse models of stress, we also found that altered expression of the SRF target genes occurred in these hearts as well. Thus, SRF target genes are actively regulated under various physiological and pathological conditions, including hemodynamic stress. The mild elevation of SRF protein in the rodent heart that is observed during typical adult aging may have a major impact on many SRF target genes, thereby affecting cardiac structure and performance. In addition, these results could help to enhance our understanding of SRF regulation of cellular processes, including metabolic and cytoskeletal function.

Its expression and prognostic value have never been explored in breast cancer. Using DNA microarray, we examined ECRG4 mRNA expression in 353 invasive breast cancer samples. A meta-analysis was performed on a large public retrospective gene expression dataset (n=1,387) to analyze correlation between ECRG4 expression and histo-clinical features including survival. To determine ECRG4 mRNA expression in breast cancer and normal breast, we first analyzed gene expression data generated by our laboratory (Institut Paoli Calmettes (IPC), Marseille, France) from cancer and normal mammary samples. Tumor tissues were from 353 patients with invasive adenocarcinoma who underwent initial surgery at IPC between 1987 and 2007. The study was approved by our institutional review board. Each patient gave a written informed consent for research use. Samples were macrodissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen within 30 min of surgical removal. All profiled specimens contained more than 60% of cancer cells (as assessed before RNA extraction using frozen sections adjacent to the profiled samples). After surgery, patients received an adjuvant multimodal treatment according to standard guidelines. Extraction of nucleic acids from frozen samples was done by using guanidium isothiocynanate and cesium chloride gradient.

"GSE29819"	"Myocardial transcriptome analysis of human arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)"	"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited cardiomyopathy primarily of the right ventricle characterized through fibrofatty replacement of cardiomyocytes. The genetic etiology in ARVC patients is most commonly caused by dominant inheritance and high genetic heterogeneity. Though histological examinations of ARVC affected human myocardium reveals fibrolipomatous replacement, the molecular mechanisms leading to loss of cardiomyocytes are largely unknown. We therefore analyzed the transcriptomes of 6 ARVC specimen derived from heart transplantation candidates and compared our findings to 6 non-failing donor hearts (NF) which could not be transplanted for technical reasons. In addition, we compared our findings to 7 hearts from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. From each heart left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) myocardial samples were analyzed by Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 arrays, adding up to six sample groups. Unsupervised cluster analyses of the six sample groups revealed a clear separation of NF and cardiomyopathy samples. However, in contrast to the other samples, unsupervised cluster analyses revealed no distinct expression pattern in LV and RV samples from ARVC-hearts. We further identified differentially expressed transcripts using t-tests and found transcripts separating diseased and NF ventricular myocardium. Of note, in failing myocardium only about 15-16% of the genes are commonly regulated compared to NF samples. In addition both cardiomyopathies are clearly distinct on the transcriptome level. Comparison of the expression patterns between the failing RV and LV using a paired t-test revealed a lack of major differences between LV and RV gene expression in ARVC hearts. Microarrays were used to elucidate the differences between non-failing control hearts and those, suffering from arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)."	"GEO"	"partial"

This excess of accumulation of GC leads to broad functional impairments in multiple organs, but the pathogenic pathways leading to lipid laden macrophages (Gaucher cells) in visceral organs and their abnormal function is obscure. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of GD, developmental global gene expression was conducted by microarray analyses of total mRNAs from lung and liver of two distinct GCase point-mutated mice (V394L/V394L and D409V/null) and genetic background matched wild-type controls. INFg regulated pro-inflammatory and IL-4 regulated anti-inflammatory cytokine/mediator network were constructed in the lung and liver of GCase mutant mice. Progressive alterations of the INFg and IL-4 pathways were similar, but to different degrees, in visceral tissues from the two different GCase mutated mice. These analyses implicate IFNg regulated pro-inflammatory and IL-4 regulated anti-inflammatory networks in the differential pathophysiological progression. In order to understand the molecular pathogenesis of GD, the disease progression in those models were inverstigated in two visceral tissues (lung and liver) at four time points according to the genotypes. 9V/null: 4 weeks (4w), 12 weeks (12w), 18 weeks (18w), 28 weeks (28w); 4L: weeks (4w), 12 weeks (12w), 18 weeks (18w), 28 weeks (28w).

"GSE19675"	"Negative regulation of the IFN/STAT signaling pathway by the Trim24 tumor suppressor protein through Rara inhibition"	"Recent genetic studies in mice have established a key role for the nuclear receptor coregulator Trim24 in liver tumor suppression and provided evidence that Trim24 suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis by inhibiting retinoic acid receptor alpha (Rara)-dependent transcription and cell proliferation. However, it is unknown which downstream targets of Rara regulated by Trim24 are critical for tumorigenesis. We report here that loss of Trim24 results in the overexpression of interferon (IFN)/STAT pathway genes in the liver, a process that occurs early in tumorigenesis and is more pronounced in tumors, despite the enhanced expression, late in the disease, of negative regulators such as Usp18, Socs1 and Socs2. Remarkably, Rara haplodeficiency, which was previously shown to suppress tumor development in Trim24-/- mice, also suppresses overexpression of the IFN/STAT pathway, thus providing evidence for a cross-pathway control that may be relevant to the transformation process. Biochemical studies revealed that Trim24 binds to the retinoic acid (RA)-responsive element in the Stat1 promoter in a RA-dependent manner and represses RA-induced transcription from this promoter. Together, these results identify Trim24 as a novel regulator of the IFN/STAT pathway and indicate that Trim24-mediated repression of the IFN/STAT signaling through Rara inhibition may play a critical role in preventing liver cancer. Generation of Trim24-/- mice has been described previously (Khetchoumian et al., 2007) by gene disruption. To generate compound mutant mice with a single allele of Rara deleted in the Trim24 -/- mutant background, we crossed Trim24 -/- mice with Rara+/- mice. The resulting Trim24+/- Rara+/- mice were generated in the hybrid (C57BL/6 (60%), 129/Sv (40%)) genetic background. These double heterozygous Trim24+/- Rara+/- mice were intercrossed to generate Trim24 -/-, Trim24 -/- Rara+/- and wild-type mice. Transcriptional profiling of mice at 5-weeks and 14-weeks of age."

This Men1 complex promotes histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation at target loci including homeobox genes and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes. The loss of Men1 may be tumorigenic because it leads to decreased histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation resulting in expressional changes of specific genes. Reversing tumorigenesis induced by a Men1 deficiency might be achieved by inhibition of histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase Rbp2 (Kdm5a). To this end, pancreatic islets from Men1f|f, Rbp2f|f and Men1f|f Rbp2f|f mice were expression profiled to determine what transcriptional changes induced by a Men1 deficiency are reversed by the loss of Rpb2.

To evaluate the efficacy of two different sources of omega-3 PUFAs, we performed gene expression profiling in the liver of mice fed diets supplemented with either fish oil or krill oil. We found that omega-3 PUFA supplements derived from a phospholipid krill fraction (krill oil) downregulated the activity of pathways involved in hepatic glucose production as well as lipid and cholesterol synthesis. The data also suggested that krill oil-supplementation increases the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Surprisingly, an equimolar dose of EPA and DHA derived from fish oil modulated fewer pathways than a krill oil-supplemented diet and did not modulate key metabolic pathways regulated by krill oil, including glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism and the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Moreover, fish oil upregulated the cholesterol synthesis pathway, which was the opposite effect of krill supplementation. Neither diet elicited changes in plasma levels of lipids, glucose or insulin, probably because the mice used in this study were young and were fed a low fat diet. Further studies of krill oil supplementation using animal models of metabolic disorders and/or diets with a higher level of fat may be required to observe these effects.

"GSE28750"	"Development and Validation of a Novel Molecular Biomarker Diagnostic Test for the Early Detection of Sepsis"	"Introduction: Sepsis is a complex immunological response to infection characterized by early hyperinflammation followed by severe and protracted immunosuppression, suggesting that a multi-marker approach has the greatest clinical utility for early detection, within a clinical environment focused on SIRS differentiation. Pre-clinical research using an equine sepsis model identified a panel of gene expression biomarkers that define the early aberrant immune activation. Thus, the primary objective was to apply these gene expression biomarkers to distinguish patients with sepsis from those who had undergone major open surgery and had clinical outcomes consistent with systemic inflammation due to physical trauma and wound healing. Methods: This was a multi-centre, prospective clinical trial conducted across 4 tertiary critical care settings in Australia. Sepsis patients were recruited if they met the 1992 Consensus Statement criteria and had clinical evidence of systemic infection based on microbiology diagnoses (n=27). Participants in the post-surgical (PS) group were recruited pre-operatively and blood samples collected within 24 hours following surgery (n=38). Healthy controls (HC) included hospital staff with no known concurrent illnesses (n=20). Each participant had minimally 5ml of PAXgene blood collected for leucocyte RNA isolation and gene expression analyses. Affymetrix array and multiplex tandem (MT)-PCR studies were conducted to evaluate transcriptional profiles in circulating white blood cells applying a set of 42 molecular markers that had been identified a priori. A LogitBoost algorithm was used to create a machine learning diagnostic rule to predict sepsis outcomes. Results: Based on preliminary microarray analyses comparing HC and sepsis groups. A panel of 42-gene expression markers were identified that represented key innate and adaptive immune function, cell cycling, WBC differentiation, extracellular remodelling and immune modulation pathways. Comparisons against GEO data confirmed the definitive separation of the sepsis cohort. Quantitative PCR results suggest the capacity for this test to differentiate severe systemic inflammation from HC is 92%. AUC ROC curve findings demonstrated sepsis prediction within a mixed inflammatory population, was between 86 - 92%. Conclusions: This novel molecular biomarker test has a clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity profile, and has the capacity for early detection of sepsis via the monitoring of critical care patients.

"GSE24206"	"Validated Gene Expression Signatures of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis"	"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic fibrosing lung disease that is difficult to diagnose and follows an unpredictable clinical course. The object of this study was to develop a predictive gene signature model of IPF from whole lung tissue. We collected whole lung samples from 11 IPF patients undergoing diagnostic surgical biopsy or transplantation. Whenever possible, samples were obtained from different lobes. Normals consisted of healthy organs donated for transplantation. We measured gene expression on microarrays. Data were analyzed by hierarchical clustering and Principal Component Analysis. By this approach, we found that gene expression was similar in the upper and lower lobes of individuals with IPF. We also found that biopsied and explanted specimens contained different patterns of gene expression; therefore, we analyzed biopsies and explants separately. Signatures were derived by fitting top genes to a Bayesian probit regression model. We developed a 153-gene signature that discriminates IPF biopsies from normal. We also developed a 70-gene signature that discriminates IPF explants from normal. Both signatures were validated on an independent cohort. The IPF Biopsy signature correctly diagnosed 76% of the validation cases (p < 0.01), while IPF Explant correctly diagnosed 78% (p < 0.001). Examination of differentially expressed genes revealed partial overlap between IPF Biopsy and IPF Explant and almost no overlap with previously reported IPF gene lists. However, several overlapping genes may provide a basis for developing therapeutic targets. 17 samples from 11 patients with IPF (6 patients provided a pair of samples from upper and lower lobes; 5 patients contributed singleton samples); 6 control specimens were obtained from routine lung volume reduction of healthy donor lungs at the time of lung transplantation."

Here we used the Infinium Methylation Platform to profile at single-CpG resolution (over 14,000 genes interrogated) the methylomes of 119 breast tumours. It emerges that many genes whose expression is linked to the ER status are epigenetically controlled (or/ we show that the two major phenotypes of breast cancers determined by ER status are widely involving epigenetic regulatory mechanisms), offering the prospect of a novel approach to treating ER-positive tumours. We have distinguished methylation-profile-based tumour clusters, some coinciding with known ""expression subtypes"" but also new entities that may provide a meaningful basis for refining breast tumour typology. We show that methylation patterns may reflect the cellular origins of tumours. Having highlighted an unexpectedly strong epigenetic component in the regulation of key immune pathways, we show that a set of immune genes have high prognostic value in specific tumour categories.

We measured gene expression from lung tissue and peripheral whole blood (PWB) from adenocarcinoma cases and controls to identify dysregulated lung cancer genes that could be tested in blood to improve identification of at-risk patients in the future. Genome-wide mRNA expression analysis was conducted in 153 subjects (73 adenocarcinoma cases, 80 controls) from the Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study using PWB and paired snap-frozen tumor and non-involved lung tissue samples. Analyses were conducted using unpaired t-tests, linear mixed effects and ANOVA models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was computed to assess the predictive accuracy of the identified biomarkers. We identified 50 dysregulated genes in stage I adenocarcinoma versus control PWB samples (False Discovery Rate ²0.1, fold change ³1.5 or ²0.66). Among them, eight (TGFBR3, RUNX3, TRGC2, TRGV9, TARP, ACP1, VCAN, and TSTA3) differentiated paired tumor versus non-involved lung tissue samples in stage I cases, suggesting a similar pattern of lung cancer-related changes in PWB and lung tissue.

Interestingly, the metabolic protection is accompanied by Smad3-/- white adipose tissue acquiring the bioenergetic and gene expression profile of brown fat/skeletal muscle. Smad3-/- adipocytes demonstrate a marked increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, with a corresponding increase in basal respiration, and Smad3 acts as a repressor of PGC-alpha1 expression.

"GSE22381"	"Identification of downstream transcriptional targets of Dlx5 during early mouse inner ear (otocyst/otic vesicle) development"	"Several transcription factors are known to be expressed in discrete regions of the otic vesicle and Dlx5 is one of those that is expressed highly in the presumptive dorsal vestibular region. Mice lacking Dlx5 have vestibular defects. Specifically, they fail to form the endolymphatic duct (a defect visible as early as E10) as well as the anterior and posterior semi-circular canals. The lateral canal does form but is smaller, whereas the saccule, the utricle and the cochlea appear relatively normal. The goal of this study was to use microarrays to identify differentially expressed genes between wild-type and Dlx5-null otic vesicles microdissected from E10 and 10.5 and identify downstream targets of Dlx5 by searching the immediate 3kb promoter regions of the differentially expressed genes for homeodomain binding sites followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation in an otic vesicle-derived cell line over-expressing Dlx5. Normal vestibular morphogenesis is compromised in mice lacking Dlx5, a member of the Distal-less family of homeobox transcription factors. We identified its direct downstream targets in the developing mouse inner ear by gene expression profiling wild-type and Dlx5 null otic vesicles from embryonic stages E10 and E10.5. Four hundred genes were differentially expressed in mutants when compared to wild-type in at least one of the two stages. To further constrain the list of likely direct targets of Dlx5, we examined the genomic DNA sequences in the 3kb promoter regions immediately proximal to the transcriptional start sites of these genes. We searched for (i) one or more previously described binding site for Dlx5, (ii) one or more novel 12bp-long motifs with a canonical homeodomain response element (HDRE) shared by promoters of two or more genes, and (iii) 100% conservation of the 12bp-long HDRE-containing motifs in promoter regions of human orthologs. Forty genes passed one or more of these filters, 12 of which are known to be expressed in the developing otic vesicle in domains that at least partially overlap with that of Dlx5 in one or both stages that we examined. Chromatin immunoprecipitation using a Dlx5 antibody confirmed direct binding of Dlx5 to promoter regions of seven of these genes (Atbf1, Bmper, Large, Lrrtm1, and Msx1, all of which were down-regulated in mutants, and Ebf1 and Lhx1, both of which were up-regulated in mutants) in an otic vesicle-derived cell line over-expressing Dlx5. Gene expression profiling of this cell line showed that Bmper and Lrrtm1 transcripts were up-regulated, further supporting their identification as direct targets of Dlx5 activity. Otic vesicles from wild-type and Dlx5-null embryos were microdissected from mouse developmental stages E10 and E10.5 and expression profiled in duplicate for each stage and genotype. Dlx5-transfected and empty vector-transfected 2B1 cell line samples were also profiled in duplicate (independent cell cultures)."	"GEO"	"partial"

Here, the role of TLRs in severe septic peritonitis using the colon ascendens stent peritonitis (CASP) model was examined. We demonstrate that mice deficient for MyD88 and TRIF had markedly reduced bacterial numbers both in peritoneal cavity and peripheral blood, indicating that bacterial clearance in this model is inhibited by TLR signals. Moreover, survival of Myd88-/-;TrifLps2/Lps2 mice was significantly improved. The lack of TLR signals prevented the excessive induction of inflammatory cytokines and of IL 10. Notably, the expression of IFN-gamma, which has an essential protective role in septic peritonitis, and of IFN-regulated genes including several p47 and p65 GTPases as well as IP 10 was independent of TLR signaling. These results provide evidence that, in severe septic peritonitis, TLR deficiency balances the innate immune response in a favorable manner by attenuating deleterious responses such as excessive cytokine release, while leaving intact protective IFN-gamma production. In this dataset, expression data of genes induced by septic peritonitis in spleens from TLR-deficient and wildtype mice are included. 3 groups (septic TLR-deficient mice, septic wildtype mice, and untreated wildtype mice) with 4 replicates each."

MEN 1 carriers commonly develop parathyroid, anterior pituitary, duodenal and pancreatic endocrine tumors. The phenotype of existing mouse models for the MEN 1 syndrome, with a germline heterozygous (hz) Men1 gene inactivation, show close resemblance to the human MEN 1 syndrome. Menin, the protein encoded for by the MEN1/Men1 gene, lacks homology with known proteins, and evidence of its involvement in different cellular processes is steadily growing. Several interaction partners have been identified, involving different interaction sites on the menin protein. Accumulating evidence suggests a role for menin in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, apoptosis, chromatin modification and DNA damage response and repair. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the MEN1 gene precedes tumor formation in the MEN 1 heterozygous pancreas. We set out to determine if there is a change in gene expression early on in the hz islet, as compared with islets in wildtype (wt) littermates, long before the LOH events occur. We performed a global mRNA expression microarray on islets from young, five-week-old, hz Men1 mice and their wt littermates, and we have subsequently corroborated a subset of the findings on the qPCR and protein level. Islets were isolated and RNA prepared from five five-week-old female mice heterozygous for the Men1 gene and five female wildtype littermates, and then a global gene expression microarray was performed."

We hypothesized that adverse outcomes from diabetic pregnancies may be linked to compromised placental function. Our goal in this study was to identify cellular and molecular abnormalities in diabetic placenta. METHODS: Using a mouse model of diabetic pregnancy, placental gene expression was assayed at midgestation and cellular composition was analyzed at various stages. Genome-wide expression profiling was validated by quantitative PCR, and tissue localization studies were performed to identify cellular correlates of altered gene expression in diabetic placenta. RESULTS: We detected significantly altered gene expression in diabetic placenta for genes expressed in the maternal as well as those in the embryonic compartments. We also found altered cellular composition of the decidual compartment. Furthermore, the junctional and labyrinth layers were reduced in diabetic placenta, accompanied by aberrant differentiation of spongiotrophoblast cells. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Diabetes during pregnancy alters transcriptional profiles in the murine placenta, affecting cells of both embryonic and maternal origin, and involving several genes not previously implicated in diabetic pregnancies. The molecular changes and abnormal differentiation of multiple cell types precede impaired growth of junctional zone and labyrinth, and placenta overall. Whether these changes represent direct responses to hyperglycaemia or physiological adaptations, they are likely to play a role in pregnancy complications and outcomes, and have implications for developmental origins of adult disease. The STZ diabetic mouse model was used to investigate gene expression changes in diabetic placentae at E10.5. Placentae were dissected from 5 different FVB dams at embryonic day 10.5 under diabetic conditions and from 5 control dams. Gene expression profiles from five individual placentae from independent pregnancies per group were compared."	"GEO"	"partial"

"GSE29458"	"Expression data from PDGF driven mouse tumors"	"Background Tumor heterogeneity is a major obstacle for finding effective treatment of Glioblastoma (GBM). Based on global expression analysis, GBM can be classified into distinct subtypes: Proneural, Neural, Classical and Mesenchymal. The signatures of these different tumor subtypes may reflect the phenotypes of cells giving rise to them. However, the experimental evidence connecting any specific subtype of GBM to particular cells of origin is lacking. In addition, it is unclear how different genetic alterations interact with cells of origin in determining tumor heterogeneity. This issue cannot be addressed by studying end-stage human tumors. Methodology/Principal Findings To address this issue, we used retroviruses to deliver transforming genetic lesions to glial progenitors in adult mouse brain. We compared the resulting tumors to human GBM. We found that different initiating genetic lesions gave rise to tumors with different growth rates. However all mouse tumors closely resembled the human Proneural GBM. Comparative analysis of these mouse tumors allowed us to identify a set of genes whose expression in humans with Proneural GBM correlates with survival. Conclusions/Significance This study offers insights into the relationship between adult glial progenitors and Proneural GBM, and allows us to identify molecular alterations that lead to more aggressive tumor growth. In addition, we present a new preclinical model that can be used to test treatments directed at a specific type of GBM in future studies. Gene expression profiling was performed on 20 tumors (12 Ptenf/f and 8 Ptenf/f; p53f/f) and 3 normal brains from mice. End stage tumors were used for expression array analysis.

The interaction of cell surface glycans with endogenous lectins in the extracellular matrix provides one mechanism by which axons can utilize specific pathways as they grow towards their targets. Beta3GnT1 mutant mice lose lactosamine expression and have an olfactory axon guidance phenotype (Henion et al, 2005). Olfactory neurons are capable of regeneration and we know that when these neurons regenerate in beta3GnT1 mutant they synthesize lactosamine by a secondary mechanism. By comparing RNA from the olfactory epithelium from wild type and mutant mice, we would expect to see the upregulation of glycosyltransferases that could produce lactosamine in the absence of beta3GnT1.

"GSE22435"	"Expression of Splicing Factor Genes is Reduced in Human Obesity and Contributes to Enhanced Lipogenesis"	"Alternative mRNA splicing provides transcript diversity and has been proposed to contribute to several human diseases. Here, we demonstrate that expression of genes regulating RNA processing is decreased in both liver and skeletal muscle of obese humans. To determine the metabolic impact of reduced splicing factor expression, we further evaluated the splicing factor, SFRS10, identified as down-regulated in obese human liver and skeletal muscle and in high fat fed rodents. siRNA-mediated reductions in SFRS10 expression induced lipogenesis and lipid accumulation in cultured hepatocytes. Moreover, SFRS10 heterozygous mice have both increased hepatic lipogenic gene expression and hypertriglyceridemia. We also demonstrate that LPIN1, a key regulator of lipid metabolism, is a splicing target of SFRS10, with reduced SFRS10 levels favoring the lipogenic beta isoform of LPIN1. Importantly, LPIN1beta-specific siRNA abolished the lipogenic effects of decreased SFRS10 expression. Together, our results indicate reduced expression of SFRS10 alters LPIN1 splicing and induces lipogenesis, demonstrating that reduced splicing factor expression observed in human tissues may contribute to metabolic phenotypes associated with human obesity. Skeletal muscle samples were obtained from 10 lean control subjects and 7 obese subjects with either IGT or DM2 undergoing elective cholecystectomy.

"GSE16790"	"Caloric Restriction in Leptin Deficiency Worsens Myocardial Steatosis"	"Caloric Restriction in Leptin Deficiency Worsens Myocardial Steatosis: Failure to Upregulate PPAR gamma and Thermogenic Glyecrolipid/Fatty Acid Cycling Growing evidence supports an anti-lipotoxic role for leptin in preventing inappropriate peripheral tissue lipid deposition. Obese, leptin deficient ob/ob mice develop left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and myocardial steatosis with increased apoptosis and decreased longevity. Here we investigated the cardiac effects of caloric restriction in leptin deficiency. Echocardiography was performed on C57Bl/6 wild-type mice (WT) and 7-month-old ob/ob mice fed ad lib, leptin-repleted (LR-ob/ob), or calorie-restricted (CR-ob/ob) for four weeks. Ventricular tissue was examined by electron microscopy (EM), mitochondrial coupling assay, and microarray expression profiling. LR and CR-ob/ob mice showed decreased body weight, heart weight, and LV wall thickness compared to ad lib ob/ob mice. LV fractional shortening was decreased in ad lib ob/ob mice, but restored to WT levels in LR and CR groups. However, EM revealed severe cardiac steatosis in the CR-ob/ob group compared to only moderate steatosis in ad lib ob/ob . Despite marked cardiac steatosis, CR (like LR) restored mitochondrial coupling to WT levels. CR up-regulated genes associated with oxidative stress and cell death, changes suggestive of cardiac lipotoxicity. LR, but not CR was shown to induce core genes involved in glycerolipid/free fatty acid cycling, a highly thermogenic pathway that can reduce intracellular lipid stores. LR, but not CR up-regulated and restored PGC1-alpha and PPAR-alpha to wild type levels; CR paradoxically further suppressed cardiac PPAR-alpha. Thus, leptin is essential in protecting the heart from lipotoxicity, and the inability to up-regulate the thermogenic glycerolipid/free fatty acid cycling pathway may impair the response of leptin deficient animals to the lipotoxic stress of calorie restriction. 6 month aged ob/ob mice were either leptin repleted with osmotic mini-pumps, calorie restricted to match the caloric intake of the leptin repleted mice, or fed ad lib for one month. 6-8 month C57Bl/6J mice were aged to serve as controls."

By looking at both the transcript and protein levels of expression, a thorough coverage of miRNA regulation was obtained. Microdissected auditory and vestibular sensory epithelia were used as the model system, thus being the first time such a comparison was carried out in a neuroepithelial system. Moreover, this is one of only a few studies employing proteome screening for the identification of miRNA targets. Notably, this approach can be employed for the study of other tissues and organs. We detected the expression of 157 miRNAs in the inner ear sensory epithelia, with 53 miRNAs differentially expressed between the cochlea and vestibule. By searching for enrichment and depletion of miRNA targets in the transcript and protein datasets with a reciprocal or similar expression, respectively, as the regulatory miRNA, we identified functionally important miRNAs. Finally, the interaction between miR-135b and PSIP1-P75, a transcriptional coacitvator previously unknown in the inner ear, was identified and validated experimentally. We suggest that miR-135b may serve as a cellular effector, involved in regulating some of the differences between the cochlear and vestibular hair cells. We investigated the mRNA expression profile of the cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia from inner ears of postnatal day 2 mice using the Affymetrix GeneChip__ 430 2Mouse Genome array. Cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia were dissected from wild type C3H mice and collected separately. The vestibular epithelia consisted of the saccule, utricle and the lateral and anterior cristae. Both the cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia were dissected with their underlying mesenchyma.

"GSE26024"	"Evaluating Gene Expression in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J Mouse Striatum Using RNA-Seq and Microarray"	"C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) are two of the most commonly used inbred mouse strains in neuroscience research. However, the only currently available mouse genome is based entirely on the B6 strain sequence. Subsequently, oligonucleotide microarray probes are based solely on this B6 reference sequence, making their application for gene expression profiling comparisons across mouse strains dubious due to their allelic sequence differences, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the RNA-Seq application provides a clear alternative to oligonucleotide arrays for detecting differential gene expression without the problems inherent to hybridization-based technologies. Using RNA-Seq, an average of 22 million short sequencing reads were generated per sample for 21 samples (10 B6 and 11 D2), and these reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome, allowing 16,183 Ensembl genes to be queried in striatum for both strains. To determine differential expression, 'digital mRNA counting' is applied based on reads that map to exons. The current study compares RNA-Seq (Illumina GA IIx) with two microarray platforms (Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 and Affymetrix MOE 430 2.0) to detect differential striatal gene expression between the B6 and D2 inbred mouse strains. We show that by using stringent data processing requirements differential expression as determined by RNA-Seq is concordant with both the Affymetrix and Illumina platforms in more instances than it is concordant with only a single platform, and that instances of discordance with respect to direction of fold change were rare. Finally, we show that additional information is gained from RNA-Seq compared to hybridization-based techniques as RNA-Seq detects more genes than either microarray platform. The majority of genes differentially expressed in RNA-Seq were only detected as present in RNA-Seq, which is important for studies with smaller effect sizes where the sensitivity of hybridization-based techniques could bias interpretation. There are 5 male and 5 female C57BL/6J animals and 5 male and 5 female DBA/2J. These are adult, naive animals. One array is run for each animal for a total of 20 Mouse MOE430 2.0 arrays.

"GSE21718"	"Developmental influence of the cellular prion protein on the gene expression profile in mouse hippocampus"	"A key event in the pathogenic process of prion diseases is the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) to an abnormal and protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc). Mice lacking PrP are resistant to prion infection, and down-regulation of PrPC during prion infection prevents neuronal loss and the progression to clinical disease. These results are suggestive of the potential beneficial effect of silencing PrPC during prion diseases. However, the silencing of a protein that is widely expressed throughout the CNS could be detrimental to brain homeostasis. The physiological role of PrPC remains still unclear, but several putative functions have been proposed. Among these, several lines of evidence support PrPC function in neuronal development and maintenance. To assess the influence of PrPC on gene expression profile during development in the mouse brain, we undertook a microarray analysis by using RNA isolated from the hippocampus, at two different developmental stages: newborn (4-day-old) and adult (3-month-old) mice, both from Prnp+/+ and Prnp0/0 animals. The comparison of the different datasets allowed us to identify ""commonly"" co-regulated genes and ""uniquely"" de-regulated genes during postnatal development in these animal models. The lack of PrPC during neuronal development affected several biological pathways, among which the most representative were cell signaling, cell-cell communication and transduction process. In addition, the absence of PrPC influenced genes involved in calcium homeostasis, nervous system development, synaptic transmission and cell adhesion. There was only a moderate alteration of the gene expression profile during neuronal development in the animal models we studied. PrPC deficiency does not lead to a dramatic alteration of gene expression profile, and produces moderate altered gene expression levels from young to adult animals. Thus, our results may provide additional support to silencing endogenous PrPC levels as a therapeutic approach to prion diseases. To analyze the influence of PrPC expression on CNS gene expression profile during development, we investigated WT PrPC (Prnp+/+) and Prnp0/0 mice at two different developmental stages: in neonatal animals (postnatal day 4, P4) and in adult animals (3 months old). For each developmental stage, hippocampi of 3 (pups) or 4 (adult) animals were dissected immediately after animal sacrifice and promptly processed for RNA extraction and purification, for a total of 14 samples."

"GSE21858"	"Patterns of gene expression and evolution in the human developing cerebral cortex"	"The cerebral cortex underwent a rapid expansion and complexification during recent primate evolution, but the underlying developmental mechanisms remain essentially unknown. In order to uncover genetic networks underlying the development of the human cerebral cortex, we profiled the transcriptome of human fetal cortical domains containing language areas of Broca and Wernicke, as well as associative areas. We thus identified hundreds of genes displaying differential expression between the two areas or between distinct temporal stages. A subset of these genes was further validated by qRTPCR and in situ hybridization, revealing novel patterns of area and layer-specific expression throughout the developing cortex at midgestation, a critical period of cortical patterning. Computational genomic analyses revealed that the proportion of genes located close to evolutionarily accelerated regions was far more abundant among the genes differentially expressed between the two cortical areas examined, but not among those differentially expressed between different stages of development. In silico screening enabled to identify accelerated regions displaying increased turnover of change in transcription factor binding sites, which were enriched among those closer to genes differentially expressed between cortical areas. Overall our work points to the identification of cortical genes that display a unique combination of patterns of evolution and expression, which may constitute an important part of the genetic framework underlying human-specific neural traits and diseases. We determined gene expression patterns in cortical domains that contain areas thought to have undergone significant divergence during primate evolution, including language areas of Broca and Wernicke, as well as association areas of the frontal and parieto-temporal cortex in the right and left sides of human fetal brains at 17 and 19 gestional weeks."

While the transcriptional program that initiates adipogenesis is well-known, the importance of microRNAs in adipogenesis is less well studied. We thus set out to investigate whether miRNAs would be actively modulated during adipogenesis and obesity. Several models exist to study adipogenesis in vitro, of which the cell line 3T3-L1 is probably the most well known, albeit not the most physiologically appropriate. We used a microarray strategy to provide a global profile of miRNAs in brown and white primary murine adipocytes (prior to and following differentiation) and evaluated the similarity of the responses to non-primary cell models, through literature data-mining. We found 65 miRNAs regulated during in vitro adipogenesis in primary adipocytes. When we compared our primary adipocyte profiles with those of cell lines reported in the literature, we found a high degree of difference in adipogenesis-regulated miRNAs. We evaluated the expression of 10 of our adipogenesis-regulated miRNAs using real-time qPCR and then selected 5 miRNAs that showed robust expression levels and profiled these by qPCR in subcutaneous adipose tissue of 20 humans with a range of body mass indices (BMI, range=21-48). Of the miRNAs tested, mir-21 was both highly expressed in human adipose tissue and positively correlated with BMI (R2=0.49, p<0.001).

CH pathophysiology is presumed to involve an activation of hypothalamic and trigeminovascular systems, but inflammation and immunological mechanisms have also been hypothesized to be of importance. Objective - A pilot study to identify differentially expressed genes during different clinical phases of CH, assuming that changes of pathophysiological importance would also be seen in peripheral venous blood. Methods - Blood samples were drawn at 3 consecutive occasions from 3 episodic CH patients: during attacks,between attacks and in remission, and at 1 occasion from 3 matchedcontrols. Global gene expression was analyzed with microarray tehnology using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 2.0 Plus GeneChip Set, covering more than 54,000 gene transcripts, corresponding to almost 22,000 genes."

Two T-ALL subtypes were identified that lacked rearrangements of known oncogenes. One subtype associated with cortical arrest, expression of cell cycle genes and ectopic NKX2-1 or NKX2-2 expression for which rearrangements were identified. The second subtype associated with immature T-cell development and high expression of the MEF2C transcription factor as consequence of rearrangements of MEF2C, transcription factors that target MEF2C or MEF2C-associated cofactors. We propose NKX2-1, NKX2-2 and MEF2C as T-ALL oncogenes that are activated by various rearrangements. This study includes 117 pediatric T-ALL samples of which 92 samples are available at GSE10609.

"GSE25462"	"Increased SRF Transcriptional Activity is a Novel Signature of Insulin Resistance in Humans and Mice"	"Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is a key phenotype associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is even present in offspring of diabetic parents. However, molecular mediators of insulin resistance remain unclear. We find that the top-ranking gene set in expression analysis of muscle from humans with T2D and normoglycemic insulin resistant subjects with parental family history (FH+) of T2D is increased expression of actin cytoskeleton genes regulated by serum response factor (SRF) and its coactivator MKL1. Furthermore, the SRF activator STARS is upregulated in FH+ and T2D and inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity. These patterns are recapitulated in insulin resistant mice, and linked to alterations in two other regulators of this pathway: reduced G-actin and increased nuclear localization of MKL1. Both genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of STARS/MKL1/SRF pathway significantly alter insulin action: 1) Overexpression of MKL1 or reduction in G-actin decreased insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation; 2) reduced STARS expression increased insulin signalling and glucose uptake, and 3) SRF inhibition by CCG-1423 reduced nuclear MKL1, improved glucose uptake, and improved glucose tolerance in insulin resistant mice in vivo. Thus, SRF pathway alterations are a signature of insulin resistance which may also contribute to T2D pathogenesis and be a novel therapeutic target. Skeletal muscle samples were obtained from 10 subjects with type 2 diabetes, 25 subjects with a family history of type 2 diabetes (one or both parents), and 15 subjects with no family history of type 2 diabetes. In this analysis RNA was isolated for cRNA preparation and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays."	"GEO"	"partial"

Methods: Laser-capture-microdissection was used to collect conjunctival forniceal epithelial cells from postnatal-day (PN) 9, PN14 and PN20 wild-type (WT), and PN14 Klf4-conditional null (Klf4CN) mice, where goblet cells are absent, developing, present, and missing, respectively. Microarrays were used to compare gene expression among these four groups. Expression of selected genes was validated by Q-RT-PCR, and spatiotemporal expression assessed by in situ hybridization. Results: We identified 668, 251, 1160 and 139 genes that were upregulated and 492, 377, 1419 and 57 genes that were downregulated between PN9 and PN14, PN14 and PN20, PN9 and PN20, and PN14 WT and Klf4CN conjunctiva, respectively. Transcription factors Spdef, FoxA1 and FoxA3 that regulate goblet cell development in other mucosal epithelia, and epithelial specific Ets (ESE) transcription factor family members were upregulated during conjunctival development. Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) was favored and diverse pathways related to glycoprotein biosynthesis, mucosal immunity, signaling, endocytic and neural regulation were affected during conjunctival development. Conjunctival Klf4-target genes differed significantly from the previously identified corneal Klf4-target genes, implying tissue-dependant regulatory targets for Klf4. Conclusions: We have identified the changes in gene expression accompanying mouse conjunctival development and the role of Klf4 in this process. These studies provide new probes to study conjunctival epithelial development and function, and reveal that the gene regulatory network required for goblet cell development is conserved across different mucosal epithelia.

"GSE32092"	"MicroRNA-mediated gene regulation plays a minor role in the transcriptomic plasticity of cold-acclimated Zebrafish brain tissue"	"Growing evidence shows that miRNAs play essential roles in cell development by regulating the growth and differentiation of cell lineages. However, the potential roles of miRNA-mediated regulation in the environmental adaptation of organisms are largely unknown. To examine this potential regulatory capability, we systematically identified and compared the miRNAs of zebrafish brains under normal and cold-acclimated conditions using Solexa sequencing. We then predicted the potential target protein genes of the miRNAs and compared their gene expression profile patterns derived from microarray analyses. We defined a set of 25 differentially expressed miRNAs between the cold-acclimatized and normal zebrafish and predicted their functions based on the GO annotation of their targets. We also compared the expression of mRNAs and found that genes related to mRNA processing and response to stress were overrepresented among the up-regulated genes of the cold-stress condition. We analyzed the potential regulatory roles of these miRNAs on gene transcription patterns under low-temperature conditions using several statistical models and a novel, network-based approach. Our results indicate that these miRNAs, either individually or together and either directly or indirectly mediated by transcription factors (TFs), contribute a minor amount to the change in gene expression patterns under low-temperature conditions. Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were raised under the normal laboratory breeding temperature (28C) or subjected subjected to cold (10C) stress. After 10 days of cold adaption, the brains of the zebrafish were dissected, and total RNAs were extracted from these brains.

Developmental arrest was observed in Sb MO which could not bypass MBT. Mid-Blastula Transition (MBT) functions as a time window for zygotic genome activation and maternal mRNA degradation. To uncover whether the ""zygotic up"" and ""maternal down"" event during MBT is retarded in Sb morphants, we performed microarray experiment at the end of MBT (about 4.3 hours post fertilication/4.3 hpf) to compare mRNAs from Sb morphants and control embryos. In one experiment, three flocks of zebrafish eggs were injected with the Sox19b morpholino immediately after fertilization, while another three control populations were injected with placebo.

Gene expression observed in these models likely includes both developmental gene expression patterns and regenerative responses to axotomy, which occurs as the result of tissue dissection. Comparison across both models revealed many genes with similar gene expression patterns during neurite outgrowth. These patterns were minimally affected by exposure to the potent inhibitory cue Semaphorin3A, indicating that this extrinsic cue does not exert major effects at the level of nuclear transcription. We also compared our data to several published studies of DRG and SCG gene expression in animal models of regeneration, and found the expression of a large number of genes in common between neurite outgrowth in vitro and regeneration in vivo. Experiment Overall Design: We wished to determine the transcriptional profiles of neurons undergoing neurite outgrowth in vitro. We were particularly interested in finding genes whose expression is generally associated with the process of neurite outgrowth, rather than with cell type-specific effects. Thus, in order to avoid focusing on transcripts unique to one tissue type versus another, we used a comparative strategy to look for effects that were common to two tissue types and therefore more likely to be involved in the general process of neurite outgrowth. While these explants contain multiple cell types, we felt this was preferable to the more disruptive conditions required to dissociate neurons or obtain a pure neuron population. To this end, we monitored gene expression in cultured explants from SCG and DRG using DNA microarrays. We initiated our studies by culturing embryonic day 13 (E13) mouse SCG in vitro and harvesting tissue for RNA isolation at time points from 2 to 65 hours. Time points were selected to detect both fast, short-term responses (2, 5 and 12 hours), as well as sustained, long-term changes (24, 40, and 65 hours).

Gene expression differences between the cell types of tumor and their respective non-cancer counterpart provide biomarker candidates. Basal cells of the bladder and prostate, although sharing CD cell surface markers, are quite different in overall gene expression. Furthermore, these cells lack transcript features of stem cell signature of embryonic stem or embryonal carcinoma cells. Cell type-specific transcriptomes are more informative than bulk tissue transcriptomes. The relatedness of different cell types can be determined by transcriptome dataset comparison.

Instead, it stimulates myeloid differentiation that progresses into a myeloproliferative-like disease. Since CREBBP is a transcriptional co-activator, we used gene expression analysis to globally assess functional deficiencies in Crebbp+/- bone marrow stroma cells at a molecular level. Ep300 encodes a protein which is highly similar in structure and function to CREBBP; nevertheless, Ep300+/- mice suffer neither excessive myeloid differentiation nor loss of HSCs. Therefore, to identify expression changes specifically related to Crebbp heterozygosity, we focused on genes that showed significant differences in expression levels between Crebbp+/- and wild-type bone marrow stroma but no difference between Ep300+/- and wild-type. Bone marrow stroma was established from wild-type, Crebbp+/- and Ep300+/- mice that were 3-4 months old for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.

A number of studies have demonstrated that neural proteoglycans are involved structural organization of the striatum and formation of dopaminergic connections to and from the striatum. Several proteoglycans are also associated with neuronal regeneration and some have been shown to be components of filamentous inclusions found in neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, the localization and proper function of dopamine receptors, which are predominantly expressed in the striatum, are governed by N-linked glycosylation events. Huntingtonís Disease (HD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, results in selective degeneration of the striatum. This is caused by a mutation in the protein, huntingtin, however, the mechanisms responsible for neuronal degeneration remain unknown. Similar to the brains of HD patients, HD transgenic mice exhibit huntingtin protein aggregation and nuclear inclusions, selective degeneration of dopamine neurons in the striatum and dopamine receptor dysfunction. In this study, the gene expression patterns of HD transgenic mice were analyzed. Four groups, pre-symptomatic HD mice (6 weeks old), WT control (6 weeks), post symptomatic HD (16 weeks), and WT control (16 weeks), were hybridized and analyzed using the GLYCOv2 array.

However, while many psoriasis mouse models have been proposed, no single model recapitulates all features of the human disease, and standardized validation criteria for psoriasis mouse models have not been widely applied. In this study, whole-genome transcriptional profiling is used to compare gene expression patterns manifested by human psoriatic skin lesions with those that occur in five psoriasis mouse models (K5-Tie2, imiquimod, K14-AREG, K5-Stat3C and K5-TGFbeta1). While the cutaneous gene expression profiles associated with each mouse phenotype exhibited statistically significant similarity to the expression profile of psoriasis in humans, each model displayed distinctive sets of similarities and differences in comparison to human psoriasis. For all five models, correspondence to the human disease was strong with respect to genes involved in epidermal development and keratinization. Immune and inflammation-associated gene expression, in contrast, was more variable between models as compared to the human disease. These findings support the value of all five models as research tools, each with identifiable areas of convergence to and divergence from the human disease. Additionally, the approach used in this paper provides an objective and quantitative method for evaluation of proposed mouse models of psoriasis, which can be strategically applied in future studies to score strengths of mouse phenotypes relative to specific aspects of human psoriasis. Global transcriptional profiling was utilized to evaluate the similarity between human psoriasis and the psoriasis-like phenotypes that develop in five mouse models (K5-Tie2, IMQ, K14-AREG, K5-Stat3C, K5-TGFbeta1) Expression patterns associated with mouse phenotypes were evaluated by comparing lesional skin from transgenic or IMQ-treated mice (n = 2-3) with normal skin obtained from control mice (n = 2-3)."

"GSE27309"	"SIRT3 opposes metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells through HIF1a destabilization"	"Tumor cells exhibit aberrant metabolism characterized by high glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen. This metabolic reprogramming, known as the Warburg effect, provides tumor cells with the substrates and redox potential required for the generation of biomass. Here, we show that the mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT3 is a crucial regulator of the Warburg effect. SIRT3 loss promotes a metabolic profile consistent with high glycolysis required for anabolic processes in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, SIRT3 mediates metabolic reprogramming independently of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and through HIF1a, a transcription factor that controls expression of key glycolytic enzymes. SIRT3 loss increases reactive oxygen species production, resulting in enhanced HIF1a stabilization. Strikingly, SIRT3 is deleted in 40% of human breast cancers, and its loss correlates with the upregulation of HIF1a target genes. Finally, we find that SIRT3 overexpression directly represses the Warburg effect in breast cancer cells. In sum, we identify SIRT3 as a regulator of HIF1a and a suppressor of the Warburg effect.

"GSE25926"	"Comparative transcriptome profiling of Amyloid Precursor Protein APP family members in the adult cortex"	"The beta-amyloid precursor protein APP and the related APLPs, undergo complex proteolytic processing giving rise to several fragments. Whereas it is well established that Abeta accumulation is a central trigger for Alzheimer disease (AD), the physiological role of APP family members and their diverse proteolytic products is still largely unknown. The secreted APPsalpha ectodomain has been shown to be involved in neuroprotection and synaptic plasticity. The gamma-secretase generated APP intracellular domain AICD, functions as a transciptional regulator in heterologous reporter assays, although its role for endogenous gene regulation has remained controversial. To gain further insight into the molecular changes associated with knockout phenotypes and to elucidate the physiological functions of APP family members including their proposed role as transcriptional regulators we performed a DNA microarray transcriptome profiling of the frontal cortex of adult wild type, APP-/-, APLP2-/- and APPsalpha knockin (KI) mice, APPalpha/alpha, expressing solely the secreted APPsalpha ectodomain. Biological pathways affected by the lack of APP family members included regulation of neurogenesis, regulation of transcription and regulation of neuron projection development. Comparative analysis of transcriptome changes and qPCR validation identified co-regulated gene sets. Interestingly, these included heat shock proteins and plasticity related genes that were down-regulated in knock-out cortices. In contrast, we failed to detect significant differences in expression of previously proposed AICD target genes including Bace1, Kai1, Gsk3b, p53, Tip60 and Vglut2. Only Egfr was slightly up-regulated in APLP2-/- mice. Comparison of APP-/- and APPalpha/alpha with wild-type mice revealed a high proportion of co-regulated genes indicating an important role of the C-terminus for cellular signaling. Finally, comparison of APLP2-/- on different genetic backgrounds revealed that background related transcriptome changes may dominate over changes due to the knockout of a single gene. Shared transcriptome profiles corroborated closely related physiological functions of APP family members in the adult central nervous system. As expression of proposed AICD target genes was not altered in adult cortex, this may indicate that these genes are not affected by lack of APP under resting conditions or only in a small subset of cells. Prefrontal cortices of adult male mice (24 - 28 weeks) of the following genotypes were analyzed: WT (n=3), APP-/- (n=3), APPalpha/alpha (n=3), APLP2-/- (n=3), APLP2(R1)-/- (n=3).

To investigate underlying pathomechanisms, we chose 6-month-old apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice, which are prone to atherosclerosis and insulin resistance, and thereby mimic the risk profile of patients with cardiovascular disease. After 8 weeks of rosiglitazone treatment (30 mg/kg/day), echocardiography and histology analyses demonstrated that rosiglitazone had induced heart failure with cardiac dilation. Concomitantly, cardiac lipid overload and lipid-induced cardiomyocyte death developed. The microarray gene expression study of heart tissue from rosiglitazone-treated apoE-deficient mice relative to untreated apoE-deficient mice and non-transgenic B6 mice identified cardiac Pparg-dependent lipid metabolism genes in rosiglitazone-treated mice, which seem to trigger a major heart failure promoting pathway. Microarray gene expression profiling was performed with heart tissue isolated from three study groups: (i) rosiglitazone-treated 8-month-old apolipoprotein (apoE)-deficient mice with symptoms of heart failure, (ii) untreated 8-month-old apoE-deficient mice, and (iii) age-matched, untreated, non-transgenic B6 control mice."

"GSE28002"	"Gene expression of the whole mouse eye"	"Background Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the elderly population worldwide. Recent studies have demonstrated strong genetic associations between AMD and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genes such as CFH and HTRA1. However, we have identified monozygotic twins discordant for AMD phenotypes (one with disease, the other without disease), suggesting that an epigenetic mechanism may also contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD. Methods We identified two twin pairs with phenotypic discordance of AMD. We obtained genomic DNA from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and subjected them to DNA methylation-chip analysis (MeDIP-chip) that profiled genome-wide DNA methylation patterns on promoters of all genes and microRNAs. We next utilized the Methyl-Profiler DNA methylation assays to detect the methylation status of selected promoters. Flow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR were used to detect the expression of the selected gene in peripheral blood cells, as well as in retinal and choroidal tissues of AMD patients and non-AMD controls. Results Our MeDIP-chip analysis identified 256 genes with hypo-methylated promoters only in the twins with AMD and 744 genes with hyper-methylated promoters only in the twins with AMD. Importantly, the promoter region of IL17RC was associated with hypo-methylated CpG sites only in the twins with AMD but not in the twins without AMD. We also found the association of the hypo-methylated IL17RC promoter with AMD in 7 pairs of siblings with discordant AMD pathology (P=0.003), as well as an independent patient cohort (95 neovascular wet and 107 geographic atrophy dry AMD patients as well as 96 non-AMD controls (95% CI, 0.01-0.10, P=9.8x10-8 for wet AMD vs. control; 95% CI, 0.05-0.32, P=2.2x10-5 for dry AMD vs. control)). Interestingly, we did not find an association between the levels of methylation on the IL17RC promoter with the previously identified genetic risk alleles in CFH, HTRA1, and ARMS2. We demonstrated an elevated expression of the IL-17RC protein in CD14+ monocytes in the peripheral blood of AMD patients as compared to non-AMD controls. These IL-17RC+ monocytes have elevated expression of CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4. In addition, IL17RC was expressed only in the retinal and choroidal tissues from AMD patients but not from age-matched controls. Conclusions We show an association of the hypo-methylated IL17RC promoter with AMD, which resulted in the elevated expression of IL-17RC in peripheral blood cells as well as the retinal and choroidal tissues of AMD patients. Our study suggests that the hypo-methylated IL17RC promoter and elevated expression of IL-17RC can potentially serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis of AMD, while IL-17RC can be a new therapeutic target for AMD. In addition, our results strongly suggest an epigenetic control mechanism of AMD pathogenesis.

Recently, a new source of myocardial cells, namely the second heart field (SHF), was discovered in the splanchnic mesoderm. Abnormal development of the SHF leads to a spectrum of outflow tract defects, such as persistent truncus arteriosus and tetralogy of Fallot. Intracellular Ca2+ signaling is known to be essential formany aspects of heart biology including heart development, but its role in the SHF is uncertain. Here, we analyzed mice deficient for genes encoding inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), which are intracellular Ca2+ release channels on the endo/sarcoplasmic reticulum that mediate Ca2+ mobilization. Mouse embryos that are double mutant for IP3R type 1 and type 3 (IP3R1-/-IP3R3-/-) show hypoplasia of the outflow tract and the right ventricle, reduced expression of specific molecular markers and enhanced apoptosis ofmesodermal cells in the SHF. Gene expression analyses suggest that IP3R-mediated Ca2+ signalingmay involve, at least in part, the Mef2C-Smyd1 pathway, a transcriptional cascade essential for the SHF. These data reveal that IP3R type 1 and type 3 may play a redundant role in the development of the SHF.

We tested the hypothesis that Pb exposure alters gene expression patterns in peripheral blood cells and that these changes reflect dose-specific alterations in the activity of particular pathways. Methodology/Principal Finding: Using Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays, we examined gene expression changes in the peripheral blood of female Balb/c mice following exposure to per os lead acetate trihydrate or plain drinking water for two weeks and after a two-week recovery period. Data sets were RMA-normalized and dose-specific signatures were generated using established methods of supervised classification and binary regression. Pathway activity was analyzed using the ScoreSignatures module from GenePattern. Conclusions/Significance: The low-level Pb signature was 93% sensitive and 100% specific in classifying samples a leave-one-out crossvalidation. The high-level Pb signature demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity in the leave-one-out crossvalidation. These two signatures exhibited dose-specificity in their ability to predict Pb exposure and had little overlap in terms of constituent genes. The signatures also seemed to reflect current levels of Pb exposure rather than past exposure. Finally, the two doses showed differential activation of cellular pathways. Low-level Pb exposure increased activity of the interferon-gamma pathway, whereas high-level Pb exposure increased activity of the E2F1 pathway. We isolate total RNA from 72 mouse whole blood samples. These included samples following a 2-week exposure to lead acetate trihydrate (untreated controls = 7; Low Pb 5ug/mL drinking water = 15; High Pb 50ug/mL drinking water = 15) and additional samples following a 2-week recovery period with plain drinking water (untreated controls = 7; Low Pb group = 15; High Pb group = 13)."

We studied the behavioral and physiological adaptation to fasting in the vinegar fly (Drosophila melanogaster). Here we show that flies demonstrated increased behavioral attraction to food odor when food-deprived with no corresponding increase in sensitivity in the peripheral olfactory system. Flies increased their food intake transiently in the post-fasted state, but returned to a stable baseline feeding level within 24 hr after return to food. This modulation in feeding was accompanied by a significant increase in the size of the crop organ of the digestive system, suggesting that fasted flies responded both by increasing their food intake and storing reserve food in their crop. The post-fasting feeding response was observed in both male and female flies of diverse genetic backgrounds. Expression profiling of head, body, and chemosensory tissues by microarray analysis revealed several hundred genes that are regulated by feeding state, including 247 genes in the fly head. We performed RNA interference-mediated knockdown of, takeout, one of the genes strongly downregulated by fasting in multiple tissues. When takeout was knocked down in all neurons the post-fasting feeding response was abolished. These observations suggest that a coordinated transcriptional response to internal physiological state may regulate both ingestive behaviors and chemosensory perception of food 6 Pool of flies were used for this experiment.

To gain insight into the molecular players involved in fly tumorigenesis we undertook genome-wide transcriptional profiling of neoplastically transformed wing imaginal discs of lgl mutants. Wild type (Canton S) wing imaginal discs served as control. The transcriptional profile, for instance, revealed the misregulation of JNK and JAK-STAT signaling which is implicated in epithelial transformation in Drosophila.

Microarray analysis revealed more than 150 genes that are expressed in a stage-specific manner during the last 24 hours of follicle development. These include all 30 previously known eggshell genes, as well as 19 new candidate chorion genes and 100 other genes likely to participate in maturation. Mutations in pxt, encoding a putative Drosophila cyclooxygenase, cause many transcripts to begin expression prematurely, and are associated with eggshell defects. Somatic activity of Pxt is required, as RNAi knockdown of pxt in the follicle cells recapitulates both the temporal expression and eggshell defects. One of the temporally regulated genes, cyp18a1, which encodes a cytochromome P450 protein mediating ecdysone turnover, is downregulated in pxt mutant follicles, and cyp18a1 mutation itself alters eggshell gene expression. These studies further define the molecular program of Drosophila follicle maturation and support the idea that it is coordinated by lipid and steroid hormonal signals. minimum of 2 replicates per stage and genotype. yw=control follicles. pxt=mutant follicles."

Here, we combined statistical Affymetrix microarray and behavioral analyses to identify key genes and pathways associated with aging-related cognitive impairment. Aged rats were separated into cognitively unimpaired (AU) or impaired (AI) groups, based on their Morris water maze performance relative to young-adult (Y) animals. Hippocampal gene expression was assessed in Y, AU and AI on the fifth (last) day of maze training or 21 days posttraining, and in non-trained aged and young animals (eight groups, overall n = 78, one chip/animal). ANOVA, linear contrasts, and overrepresentation analyses identified genes and pathways that differed from Y generally with aging (in both AU and AI) or selectively with cognitive status (only in AI or AU). Plasticity pathways, including insulin/cAMP/IEG signaling, and glycogenolytic and lipogenic pathways, were selectively downregulated (5 days) in AI, whereas Notch2 (regulating oligodendrocyte differentiation) and myelination pathways were upregulated (particularly at 21 days). Downregulation with general aging occurred in signal transduction and axonal growth/transport pathways, whereas upegulation occurred in immune/inflammatory, lipid metabolism/transport (e.g., Lxr-Srebf1), and lysosomal pathways. In AU, receptor/signal transduction genes were selectively upregulated, suggesting possible compensatory mechanisms. Immunohistochemistry confirmed and extended results to the protein level. Thus, this study identified novel cognition-linked processes, suggesting a new model in which energy-intensive, plasticity/lipogenic processes and energy-generating pathways necessary for learning are coordinately downregulated during training, while myelinogenic programs that impair cognition are concurrently activated.

We hypothesize that a change in the patterns of gene expression is important in these age-related events. To test this, hearts were harvested from young and aged male rats (3-4 and 20-22 mo, respectively). Total mRNA was extracted and prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix U34A GeneChips. Filtering criteria, involving fold change and a statistical significance cutoff were employed, yielding 263 probe pairs exhibiting differential signals. Of the 163 annotated genes, at least 56 (34%) were classified as signaling/cell communication. Of these 56, approximately half were directly involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. We next determined which of these changes might be involved in anti-adrenergic activity and identified 19 potentially important gene products. Importantly, we observed a decrease in beta1-adrenergic receptor and adenylyl cyclase mRNAs, whereas the mRNA encoding beta-arrestin increased. Furthermore, the results demonstrate an increase in mRNAs encoding the adenosine A1 receptor and phospholipase D, which could increase anti-adrenergic effects. Moreover, the mRNAs encoding the muscarinic M3 receptor, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta3, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-related protein were increased as was the mRNA encoding guanylate kinase-associated protein. Interestingly, we also observed eight mRNAs whose abundance changed three- to sixfold with aging that could be considered as being compensatory. Although these results do not prove causality, they demonstrate that cardiac aging is associated with changes in the profiles of gene expression and that many of these changes may contribute to reduced adrenergic signaling.

"#GSE3253"	"Exaggerated neuroinflammation and sickness behavior in aged mice after activation of the peripheral innate immune system"	"Acute cognitive impairment (i.e., delirium) is common in elderly emergency department patients and frequently results from infections that are unrelated to the central nervous system. Since activation of the peripheral innate immune system induces brain microglia to produce inflammatory cytokines that are responsible for behavioral deficits, we investigated if aging exacerbated neuroinflammation and sickness behavior after peripheral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microarray analysis revealed a transcriptional profile indicating the presence of primed or activated microglia and increased inflammation in the aged brain. Furthermore, aged mice had a unique gene expression profile in the brain after an intraperitoneal injection of LPS, and the LPS-induced elevation in the brain inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress was both exaggerated and prolonged compared with adults. Aged mice were anorectic longer and lost more weight than adults after peripheral LPS administration. Moreover, reductions in both locomotor and social behavior remained 24 h later in aged mice, when adults had fully recovered, and the exaggerated neuroinflammatory response in aged mice was not reliably paralleled by increased circulating cytokines in the periphery. Taken together, these data establish that activation of the peripheral innate immune system leads to exacerbated neuroinflammation in the aged as compared with adult mice. This dysregulated link between the peripheral and central innate immune system is likely to be involved in the severe behavioral deficits that frequently occur in older adults with systemic infections.

"#GSE3305"	"Age alters the gene expression profiles of rat oculomotor nucleus and spinal cord"	"Some of the most common neurodegenerative disorders have a strong association with aging. Curiously, these conditions tend to involve specific areas of the central and peripheral nervous system, at least initially. For example, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis preferentially targets spinal motor neurons and spares oculomotor neurons. This suggests that aging has divergent effects on brain stem and spinal cord, a factor that may explain differential susceptibility to certain neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, for this study we asked whether aging induces a change in the evolution of the transcriptome of oculomotor nucleus (OMN) throughout the lifespan which would be different than that of the spinal cord aging. Age induced a transcriptome shift to a pattern consistent with inflammation/immune response in both OMN and spinal cord. However, the response was more dramatic in the spinal cord. On the other hand, age repressed genes coding ion channels and transporters in OMN and cytoskeletal proteins in the spinal cord. The results indicate that OMN and spinal cord transcriptomes change differently with age. The results give an initial glimpse of how tissue-specific gene expression patterns may underlie the differential susceptibility to age-related neuromuscular dysfunction.

"#GSE3309"	"Aging extraocular muscles: shifts in gene expression patterns"	"The fast and constant activity of the extraocular muscles (EOMs) impose mechanical and metabolic stresses not typically seen in limb skeletal muscles. These functional properties may explain why EOMs seem to age at a faster rate than other skeletal muscles. Using high-density cDNA microarrays, this study investigated the gene expression profile of EOMs and extensor digitorum longus muscles (EDL) of Fischer 344/Brown Norway F1 hybrid rats at 6-, 18- and 30-months of age. At 6-mo, 705 genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were differentially expressed in EOMs (436 up, 269 down). Overall, the EOM profile at this age was mostly consistent with the increased expression of fetal, developmental and EOM-specific myosin isoforms, enzymes involved in glycolysis and TCA cycle, and ion transporters and pumps, confirming the notion that EOM may represent a distinct muscle group (PNAS 98:12062, 2001). Interestingly, at 18-mo only 36 probes were significantly different in EOM (15 up, 21 down), most of them ESTs. However, at 30-mo EOMs had 655 differentially expressed genes and ESTs (480 up, 175 down). In this age group, the EOM expression profile reverted to a pattern similar to that found at 6-mo, with evidence of ongoing tissue remodeling and increased expression of antioxidant enzymes. These results indicate that the gene expression profile of EOM and EDL evolve differently throughout the lifespan.

"#GSE3310"	"Aging laryngeal muscle: shifts in gene expression patterns and function"	"Sarcopenia is the decreased muscle mass and weakness associated with aging and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. To what extent non-locomotive muscles are susceptible to this condition is unclear. For example, age affects laryngeal function (ventilation, airway protective reflexes, swallowing and phonation). Age-related laryngeal dysfunction may be due to effects on its intrinsic muscles that have a unique phenotype: very small, mostly fast oxidative muscle fibers. For this study, we examined how age alters the functional characteristics and gene expression profile of posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA), an intrinsic laryngeal muscle. PCA muscles from Fischer 344-Brown Norway F1 hybrid rats (6 and 30 months of age) were used for cDNA microarrays, light and electron (EM) microscopy, and in vitro contractile function. Histological analyses demonstrated a ~40% increase in mean PCA fiber size and in the number of fibers with low myosin ATPase activity. There was also evidence of ragged-red fibers, a hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction. In turn, mitochondrial volume density, determined by EM, was significantly higher in PCA muscles at 30 months (43% vs. 21% at 6 months). In vitro function showed a decrease in velocity of unloaded shortening at 30 months. Finally, cDNA microarrays demonstrated a transcriptome shift in PCA muscle with age. Gene classes with the largest changes were: signal transduction, transcription factors, and metabolic enzymes. These data demonstrate that PCA muscles are significantly altered by age. Moreover, the observed changes in muscle fiber size, mitochondrial content and gene expression profile suggest that the PCA response to age diverges from that seen in more typical skeletal muscles.

The most relevant experimental model of HAD, rhesus macaques exhibiting SIV encephalitis (SIVE), closely reproduces the human disease and has been successfully used to advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying HAD. In this study we integrate gene expression data from uninfected and SIV-infected hippocampus with a human protein interaction network and discover modules of genes whose expression patterns distinguish these two states, to facilitate identification of neuronal genes that may contribute to SIVE/HIV cognitive deficits. Using this approach we identify several downregulated candidate genes and select one, EGR1, a key molecule in hippocampus-related learning and memory, for further study. We show that EGR1 is downregulated in SIV-infected hippocampus and that it can be downregulated in differentiated human neuroblastoma cells by treatment with CCL8, a product of activated microglia. Integration of expression data with protein interaction data to discover discriminatory modules of interacting proteins can be usefully employed to prioritize differentially expressed genes for further study. Investigation of EGR1, selected in this manner, indicates that its downregulation in SIVE may occur as a consequence of the host response to infection, leading to deficits in cognition."

However, the temporal relationships among these expression changes or with cognitive impairment have not been studied in depth. Here, using Affymetrix microarrays, immunohistochemistry and Morris water maze cognitive testing across 5 age groups of male F344 rats (n=9-15/group, one microarray per animal), we systematically analyzed the temporal sequence and cellular localization of aging changes in expression. These were correlated with performance scores on the hippocampus-dependent Morris Water Maze task. Significant microarray results were sorted in to Early, Intermediate, Midlife, and Late patterns of expression, and functionally categorized (Early- downregulated neural development, lipid synthesis and energy-utilization; upregulated ribosomal synthesis, growth, stress/inflammatory, lysosome and protein/lipid degradation. Intermediate- increased defense/inflammatory activation and decreased transporter activity; Midlife- downregulated energy-dependent signaling and neurite growth, upregulated astroglial activation, Ca2+-binding, cholesterol/lipid trafficking, myelinogenic processes and additional lysosome/inflammation; Late- further recruitment of genes in already-altered pathways). Immunohistochemistry revealed a primarily astrocytic localization of the processes upregulated in midlife, as well as increased density of myelin proteins. Evidence of cognitive impairment first appeared in the 12-month-old group (midlife) and was increased further in the 23-month-old group, exhibiting the highest correlations with some upregulated genes related to cholesterol transport (e.g., Apoe, Abca2), protein management and ion binding. Some upregulated genes for inflammation (Il6st) and myelinogenesis (Pmp22) also correlated with impairment. Together, the data are consistent with a novel sequential cascade model of brain aging in which metabolic alterations early in maturity are followed by inflammation and midlife activation of an astrocyte-centered cholesterol trafficking pathway that stimulates oligodendrocyte remyelination programs. Importantly, this cholesterol trafficking pathway also may compete for astroglial bioenergetic support of neurons, in turn, leading to downregulation of energy-dependent pathways needed to sustain cognitive functions."
