WBStrain00000001	N2	Caenorhabditis elegans	C. elegans var Bristol. Generation time is about 3 days. Brood size is about 350. Also CGC reference 257. Isolated from mushroom compost near Bristol, England by L.N. Staniland. Cultured by W.L. Nicholas, identified to genus by Gunther Osche and species by Victor Nigon; subsequently cultured by C.E. Dougherty. Given to Sydney Brenner ca. 1966. Subcultured by Don Riddle in 1973. Caenorhabditis elegans wild isolate. DR subclone of CB original (Tc1 pattern I). [NOTE: This stock might carry a ~1.8 kb deletion in alh-2 in the background.]	C. elegans wild isolate.		
WBStrain00000002	VC2010	Caenorhabditis elegans	This strain was provided by the C. elegans Reverse Genetics Core Facility at the University of British Columbia, which is part of the International C. elegans Gene Knockout Consortium, which should be acknowledged in any publications resulting from its use.	C. elegans wild isolate.		
WBStrain00000003	N2 (ancestral)	Caenorhabditis elegans	WT C. elegans. From Cambridge collection-originally frozen around 1968: In 1980, in order to establish an ancestral stock, Jonathan Hodgkin thawed one of the earliest frozen tubes of N2, dating from 1968. From this plate J.H. grew up a population en masse (without subculturing) on NGM plates (about 2 generations). Multiple samples of this were frozen in order to provide a reference N2 stock. This set of stock samples was replenished by regrowth in 1985 and 1991, using the same procedure, and a freshly thawed sample was sent to the CGC in 1993. Thus, samples from this frozen stock, called N2 (ancestral), should be only about 6 generations away from the stock used by Sydney Brenner as his standard WT N2. [Isolated from mushroom compost near Bristol, England by L.N. Staniland. Cultured by W.L. Nicholas, identified to genus by Gunther Osche and species by Victor Nigon; subsequently cultured by C.E. Dougherty. Given to Sydner Brenner ca. 1966.] Caenorhabditis elegans wild isolate. Note: N2 (ancestral) has reduced lifespan and fertility relative to the standard CGC N2 strains.

WBStrain00026322	LSJ1	Caenorhabditis elegans	This strain has been grown axenically in liquid culture for several years. It was grown on E. coli OP50 so that it could be raised on agar plates and frozen. It will need to have the E. coli removed. This culture originated at UC Berkeley and was once called C. briggsae UC Berkeley strain. Caenorhabditis elegans wild isolate.	C. elegans wild isolate.		
WBStrain00026323	LSJ2	Caenorhabditis elegans	LSJ2 is a sister strain to the standard N2 laboratory strain. Both LSJ2 and N2 are descended from a single animal isolated by W. Nicholas from a mushroom compost culture provided by L. Staniland in Bristol, England. The strain was transferred to E. Dougherty's laboratory at the Kaiser Foundation Research Institute in the 1950s, and in the late 1950s it separated into two substrains. One of these substrains was mistakenly believed to be C. briggsae and represents the LSJ2 lineage. S. Brenner received a cultivar of the second substrain from E. Dougherty in 1964; this cultivar became N2. The LSJ2 lineage was continuously cultivated in liquid axenic media at the University of California, Berkeley and at San Jose State University thereafter. In 1995, a cultivar of the strain was sent to the Caenorhabditis genetics centre and frozen to become LSJ1. In 2009, N. Lu from San Jose State University provided a second cultivar of the strain that had been grown for an additional 14 ears in axenic media; this strain is designated LSJ2.	C. elegans wild isolate.

WBStrain00030553	PD1074	Caenorhabditis elegans	A defined and recently cloned population of animals derived from the original Bristol variant of C. elegans originally obtained by Brenner from E. Dougherty with no known history of mutagenesis. Brenners original population, called N2, was used as the basis for the vast majority of laboratory strains in use currently. No early frozen stock of the unmutagenized N2 population currently exists, but later stocks were available from several laboratories. PD1074 is a clonal population founded by picking a single worm of one such stock, VC3510. VC3510 in turn derives from a subpopulation of N2 described in the literature as VC2010. PD1074 is intended to be used as a wild type reference strain with the closely matched genome assembly of Yoshimura et al (ref) available on Wormbase as VC2010-1.0. (ENA study accession PRJEB28388; assembly accession GCA_900538205). We note that PD1074 is expected to be largely similar to most lab N2 strains, but that as a clonal isolate derived from N2, there will be some loci that will vary compared to any other particular N2 isolate. One such example is a partial deletion of the alh-2 locus in PD1074. Additional loci that were found to vary between the prior N2 reference genome (WormBase release WS264) and the VC2010-1.0 assembly are detailed in supplemental table 8 in Yoshimura et al (ref).
