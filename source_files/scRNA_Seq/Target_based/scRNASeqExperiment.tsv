Blood develops from mesoderm, which is specified at gastrulation. We therefore sorted cells from mouse embryos between E6.5 and E7.75 to capture gastrulation and the emergence of mesoderm, followed by specificiation of the first mature blood cells."

"SRP094958"	"Genomic profiling of human spermatogonial stem cells [scRNA-Seq]"	"To better understand human spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), we profiled their transciptome and epigenome, which revealed the mechanism how human SSCs regulates their self-renewal versus differentiation dermination, as well as how latent pluripotency is established in human SSCs. Remarkly, we discovered signaling pathways (e.g. LIF, BMP, WNT) that differentially regulated self-renewal vesus differentiation in SSCs. We also discovered that SSCs repress core pluripotent factors (Sox2, Pou5f1 and Nanog) yet activate ancillary factors (e.g. Klf4, Mbd3, Tcf3, Sall4) transcriptionally and epigenetically. Overall design: Using SSEA4 as self-renewal marker and Kit as differentiating marker, we isolated self-renewal and differentiation SSCs by magnetic antibody cell sorting (MACS). SSEA4+ or Kit+ cells were loaded into 5-10 microm integrated fluidic circuits (IFCs) using Fluidigm C1 instrument. Single cells in IFCs were lysed and total RNA was harvested for polyadenylation selection, reverse transcription and PCR amplification.

In a particular cell, a gene could potentially be expressed from both copies (biallelic expression) or only one (monoallelic). We performed RNA-Sequencing on individual cells, from zygote to the cells of the late blastocyst, and also individual cells from the adult liver. Using first generation crosses between two distantly related mouse strains, CAST/Ei and C57BL/6, we determined the expression separately from the maternal and paternal alleles. We found that half of the genes were expressed by only one allele, randomly so that some cells would express the paternal allele, some the maternal and a few cell both alleles. We also observed the spread of the progressive inactivation of the paternal X chromosome.

"SRP075496"	"Single cell transcriptome analysis of human pancreas reveals transcriptional signatures of aging and somatic mutation patterns"	"As organisms age, cells accumulate genetic and epigenetic changes that eventually lead to impaired organ function or catastrophic failure such as cancer. Here we describe a single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2544 human pancreas cells from donors, spanning six decades of life. We find that islet cells from older donors have increased levels of disorder as measured both by noise in the transcriptome and by the number of cells which display inappropriate hormone expression, revealing a transcriptional instability associated with aging. By analyzing the spectrum of somatic mutations in single cells from previously-healthy donors, we find a specific age-dependent mutational signature characterized by C to A and C to G transversions, indicators of oxidative stress, which is absent in single cells from human brain tissue or in a tumor cell line. Cells carrying a high load of such mutations also express higher levels of stress and senescence markers, including FOS, JUN, and the cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase SOD1, markers previously linked to pancreatic diseases with substantial age-dependent risk, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and adenocarcinoma. Thus, our single-cell approach unveils gene expression changes and somatic mutations acquired in aging human tissue, and identifies molecular pathways induced by these genetic changes that could influence human disease. Also, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using single-cell RNA-seq data from primary cells to derive meaningful insights into the genetic processes that operate on aging human tissue and to determine which molecular mechanisms are coordinated with these processes.

We further utilize a medium-depletion approach to identify molecular factors regulating cell-subtype proportion in organoids.

Here we demonstrate a reproducible method with minimal artifacts for single-nucleus Droplet-based RNA sequencing (snDrop-Seq) that we use to resolve thirty distinct cell populations in human adult kidney. We define molecular transition states along more than ten nephron segments spanning two major kidney regions. We further delineate cell type-specific expression of genes associated with chronic kidney disease, diabetes and hypertension, providing insight into possible targeted therapies. This includes expression of a hypertension-associated mechano-sensory ion channel in mesangial cells, and identification of proximal tubule cell populations defined by pathogenic expression signatures. Our fully optimized, quality-controlled transcriptomic profiling pipeline constitutes a tool for the generation of healthy and diseased molecular atlases applicable to clinical samples.

Further, intermediate states along the course of maturation of these cell types have been poorly characterized. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map the Drosophila larval hemocytes across different inflammatory conditions. We identified all known cell types, resolved PMs into different states based on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, antimicrobial response, and metabolism together with the detection of CC and LM intermediates. Further, we discovered rare cells within CC and LM populations that express the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligand branchless (bnl) and receptor breathless (btl), respectively. We demonstrate that both bnl and btl are required for mediating effective immune responses against parasitoid wasp eggs in vivo, highlighting a novel role for FGF signaling in inter-hemocyte crosstalk.

To gain insight into general principles that govern how transcription factors regulate cell type diversity, we used large-scale single-cell mRNA sequencing to characterize the extensive cellular diversity in the Drosophila optic lobes. We sequenced 57,000 single optic lobe neurons and glia and assigned them to 52 clusters of transcriptionally distinct single cells. We validated the clustering and annotated many of the clusters using RNA sequencing of characterized FACS-sorted single cell types, as well as marker genes specific to given clusters. To identify transcription factors responsible for inducing specific terminal differentiation features, we used machine-learning to generate a *random forest* model. The predictive power of the model was confirmed by showing that two transcription factors expressed specifically in cholinergic (apterous) and glutamatergic (traffic-jam) neurons are necessary for the expression of ChAT and VGlut in many, but not all, cholinergic or glutamatergic neurons, respectively. Therefore, the same terminal characters can be regulated by different transcription factors in different cell types, arguing for extensive phenotypic convergence. Our data provide a deep understanding of the developmental and functional specification of a complex brain structure.

We determine a novel transcriptional signature of the most invasive neural crest Trailblazer cells that is consistent during migration and enriched for approximately 900 genes. Knockdown of several Trailblazer genes shows significant but modest changes to total distance migrated. However, in vivo expression analysis by RNAscope and immunohistochemistry reveals some salt and pepper patterns that include strong individual Trailblazer gene expression in cells within other subregions of the migratory stream. These data provide new insights into the molecular diversity and dynamics within a neural crest cell migratory stream that underlie complex directed and collective cell behaviors.

A hallmark event of gastrulation is the formation of the primitive streak, a linear assembly of cells along the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the developing organism. To examine the primitive streak at a single-cell resolution, we measured the transcriptomes of individual chick cells from the streak or the surrounding tissue (the rest of the area pellucida) in Hamburger-Hamilton stage 4 embryos. The single-cell transcriptomes were then ordered by the statistical method Wave-Crest to deduce both the relative position along the AP axis and the prospective lineage of single cells. The ordered transcriptomes reveal intricate patterns of gene expression along the primitive streak. Overall design: Examination of single-cells of stage 4 chicken embryos."

To identify regulators and morphogens active in mesenchyme, we performed transcriptomic analysis using Tag-seq, RNA-seq, and single cell RNA-seq and defined new mesenchymal subsets and markers. We documented transcript expression using Tag-seq and RNA-seq in female rat Ventral Mesenchymal Pad (VMP) as well as adjacent urethra comprised of smooth muscle and peri-urethral mesenchyme. Transcripts enriched in VMP were identified in Tag-seq data from microdissected tissue, and RNA-seq data derived from cell populations and single cells.

Comparison with single cell RNA-seq identified transcripts yielded 45 transcriptscommon to both approaches. Cell subset analysis showed that VMP and adjacent mesenchyme were composed of distinct cell types and that each tissue was comprised of two subgroups. Markers for these subgroups were highly subset specific. Thirteen transcripts were validated by qPCR to confirm cell specific expression in microdissected tissues, as well as expression in neonatal prostate. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that Ebf3 and Meis2 showed a restricted expression pattern in VMP condensed mesenchyme.

"SRP131761"	"Spatial and single-cell transcriptional profiling identifies functionally distinct human dermal fibroblast subpopulations"	"Fibroblasts synthesize the extracellular matrix of connective tissue and play an essential role in maintaining tissue integrity. We have previously shown that mouse skin connective tissue, the dermis, is comprised of functionally distinct fibroblast lineages. However, the extent of fibroblast heterogeneity in human skin is unknown. Here, using a combination of spatial transcriptional profiling of human and mouse dermis and single cell transcriptional profiling of human dermal fibroblasts, we show that there are at least four distinct fibroblast populations in adult human skin. We define markers permitting prospective isolation of these cells and show that although marker expression is rapidly lost in culture, different fibroblast subpopulations retain distinct functionality in terms of Wnt signalling, T cell communication and the ability to support human epidermal reconstitution in organotypic culture. Furthermore, while some fibroblast subpopulations are spatially segregated, others are not. These findings have profound implications for normal wound healing and diseases characterized by excessive fibrosis, and suggest that ex vivo expansion or in vivo ablation of specific fibroblast subpopulations may have therapeutic applications.

"SRP269263"	"Single-cell transcriptomics uncovers human corneal limbal stem cells and its differentiation trajectory"	"Limbal stem cells (LSCs), known as corneal epithelial stem cells, are located at the basal epithelial layer of the corneal limbus and serve an important function in maintaining the homeostasis of the corneal epithelium. Several putative molecular markers of LSCs have been previously identified. However, the specificity of these markers remains largely controversial. To address this gap in the current understanding of LSCs, we performed a transcriptome profiling of heterogeneous corneal limbal basal cells using single-cell transcriptomics technology to identify LSCs and their exclusive markers. We isolated limbal basal cells from two young donors, constructed scRNA-seq libraries, generated RNA-sequencing data using the 10x Genomics platform, and then finally obtained the transcriptome of about 18,000 individual single-cells using Cell ranger (https://10xgenomics.com). Next, we performed quality control, filtering and data integration using Seurat package (https://satijalab.org/seurat), about 16,400 cells were retained for further downstream analysis such as dimensional reduction, unsupervised clustering, and Differentially expressed gene selection, trajectory analysis and visualization. We identified 11 unique clusters of cells assigned to a putative cell type based on published known biomarkers for differentiation, proliferation and putative epithelial stem cells. As a results, we found 2 Terminally Differentiated Cell (TDC), 3 Post-Mitotic Cell (PMC), 1 Transient Amplifying Cell (TAC), 2 Limbal Progenitor Cell (LPC), Putative Limbal Stem Cell (LSC) and 2 Melanocyte (MC) sub-cell type clusters. Furthermore, we confirmed the trajectory order of LSC differentiation for 9 clusters using Pseudotemporal and Functional PCA analysis. Lastly, we validated each assigned cell subtypes and determined their location in human corneal limbus tissue with 9 markers using RNAscope We were able to reveal the heterogeneity of corneal limbal basal epithelium by defining novel dynamic trajectories for cell types in a pseudotemporal manner. This approach allowed us to identify the distinct clusters of LSCs and progenitors with exclusively expressed markers, and might apply for translational research on regenerating a normal corneal epithelium and restoring vision. Overall design: We isolated limbal basal cells from two young donors, constructed scRNA-seq libraries, generated RNA-sequencing data using the 10x Genomics platform, and then finally obtained the transcriptome of about 18,000 individual single-cells using Cell ranger (https://10xgenomics.com).

Successful ureter engineering is necessitated by detailed understanding of the tissue architecture, cellular heterogeneity, and signaling pathways underlying regeneration. We define and spatially map cell populations within the human ureter by using a combinatorial approach: single-cell RNA sequencing, 10X Visium spatial transciptomics, and immunofluorescence. The stromal and urothelial cell populations are analyzed in detail, and we infer potential cell-cell communication networks underpinning the bi-directional crosstalk between these compartments. Specifically, we analyze and experimentally validate the importance of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway in adult stem cell maintenance. The SHH-expressing basal cells support organoid generation in vitro, and accurately predict the differentiation trajectory of basal stem cells, to terminally differentiated umbrella cells, in vivo. Our results highlight essential processes involved in adult ureter tissue homeostasis, and provide a toolkit for guiding ureter tissue engineering. Overall design: 10 normal human ureters each were subjected to RNA sequencing at single cell resolution on Novaseq using 10X Gemonics library preparation platform. Data was processed using Cellranger 4.0.0 and anayzed using Seurat v3.2.1 to characterize various cell types and understand finer details of the regenrative pathways in the ureter urothelium.

Secondly, we define additional cell types/states, as well as spatially map novel and known human airway cell types, such as adult lung chondrocytes, submucosal gland (SMG) duct cells, distinct pericyte and smooth muscle subtypes, immune-recruiting fibroblasts, peribronchial and perichondrial fibroblasts, peripheral nerve associated fibroblasts and Schwann cells. Finally, we define a survival niche for IgA-secreting plasma cells at the SMG, comprising the newly defined epithelial SMG-Duct cells, and B and T lineage immune cells. Using our transcriptomic data for cell-cell interaction analysis, we propose a signalling circuit that establishes and supports this niche. Overall, we provide a transcriptional and spatial lung atlas with multiple novel cell types that allows for the study of specific tissue microenvironments such as the newly defined gland-associated lymphoid niche (GALN)."

To investigate neurogenic potential and cellular diversity, we profiled single-nucleus transcriptomes in five hippocampal-entorhinal subregions in human, macaque, and pig. Integrated cross-species analysis revealed robust transcriptomic and histologic signatures of neurogenesis in adult mouse, pig and macaque, but not humans. Doublecortin (DCX), a widely accepted marker of newly generated granule cells, was detected in diverse human neurons, but it did not define immature neuron populations. To explore species differences in cellular diversity and implications for disease, we characterized subregion-specific transcriptomically-defined cell types and transitional changes from the three-layered archicortex to the six-layered neocortex. Notably, METTL7B defined subregion-specific excitatory neurons and astrocytes in primates, associated with endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplet proteins, including Alzheimer's disease-related proteins.

"SRP269777"	"The molecular landscape of neural differentiation inthe developing Drosophila brain revealed by targeted scRNA-seq and multi-informatic analysis"	"In this work, Michki et. al. isolate neurons and neural progenitors from the developing Drosophila brain. Through a combination of in silico and in situ techniques, they map out the expression dynamics of a variety of molecular factors that may play a role in specifying terminal neural fates at the RNA level, and provide tools to enable similar analyses to be performed in other systems. Overall design: R9D11-Gal4 genetic driver was used with a UAS:hH2B-2xmNG reporter to label type-II neural lineages in third instar larval brains. 20 brains were dissected, dissociated, and sorted on a Sony MA900 FACS machine. 10,000 cells were sequenced in a single lane of a 10Xchromium chip using their v3 chemistry. Cells were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq/HiSeq4000 with 400M reads allocated to this library. 6092 cells were identified with a mean read count of 97,604 reads/cell when aligned to the BDGP6(2014-07) Drosophila genome assembly from ENSEMBL using STAR.

To address this, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing on wild-type Canton-S adult eyes from 1 day old male and female, 3-day and 7-day old male flies. These data sets will serve as an valuable resource for future research using the adult eye.

"SRP167086"	"Single cell RNAseq of mouse olfactory bulb reveals cellular heterogeneity and activity dependent molecular census of adult-born neurons"	"Cellular heterogeneity within the mammalian brain poses a challenge towards understanding its complex functions. Within the olfactory bulb (OB), odor information is processed by subtypes of inhibitory interneurons whose heterogeneity and functionality is influenced by ongoing adult neurogenesis. To investigate this cellular heterogeneity, and to better understand the developmental programs of adult-born neurons, we utilized single cell RNA sequencing and computational modeling to reveal diverse and transcriptionally distinct neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. We also analyzed molecular changes during adult-born interneuron maturation, and uncovered developmental programs within their gene expression profiles. Finally, we discovered that distinct neuronal subtypes are differentially affected by sensory experience. Together, these data provide a transcriptome-based foundation for investigating subtype-specific neuronal function in the OB, charting the molecular profiles that arise during the maturation and integration of adult-born neurons, and documenting activity-dependent changes in the cellular composition of the olfactory system. Overall design: To develop a comprehensive profile of cellular heterogeneity within the OB, here we employed high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (Zheng et al. 2017) of activity manipulated and wildtype mouse olfactory bulbs. This technique allows an in-depth categorization of single cell molecular signatures, and provides an analysis of potential developmental and activity-dependent changes that occur in adult-born neuron populations. Together, our data inform the heterogeneity of interneurons within the OB, provide a molecular blueprint of stereotyped developmental programs for OB interneurons, and reveal the transcriptional changes that govern activity-dependent circuit integration of adult-born neurons. Furthermore, our results suggest that distinct molecular mechanisms act on different subsets of adult-born neurons, driving diversity and survival of adult-born interneuron subsets in an activity-dependent manner."

"SRP303345"	"Single cell analysis of the ventricular-subventricular zone reveals signatures of dorsal and ventral adult neurogenic lineages. [single whole-cell]"	"Purpose: While great progress has been made in understanding the differences in regional stem cell potential using viral and genetic lineage tracing strategies, the core molecular heterogeneity that underlies these regional differences is largely unknown. Methods: Here we present a single whole-cell sequencing dataset of microdissected adult hGFAP:GFP mouse V-SVZ. Four samples were (two samples from male mice, two samples from female mice) multiplexed & combined using MULTI-Seq barcodes (McGinnes et al. 2019), labeled with TotalSeq antibodies against VCAM1 and CD24 proteins (Biolegend), and were split into two technical replicate lanes on a 10x Chromium Single Cell Controller chip for single cell barcoding. Genomic libraries were prepared using standard Illumina protocols, and barcode libraries (MULTI-Seq, TotalSeq) were prepared using MULTI-Seq protocols. Results: Here we present single whole-cell and single nucleus sequencing datasets of microdissected adult mouse V-SVZ, and evidence for the existence of two broad subtypes of adult neural stem cells. By using spatially resolved microdissections in the single nucleus sequencing dataset as a reference, and mapping marker gene expression in the V-SVZ, we find that these two populations reside in largely non-overlapping domains in either the dorsal or ventral V-SVZ. Furthermore, we identified two subpopulations of newly born neurons that have gene expression consistent with dorsal or ventral origins. Finally, we identify genes expressed by both stem cells and the neurons they generate that specifically mark either the dorsal or ventral adult neurogenic lineage. These datasets, methods and findings will enable future study of region-specific regulation of adult neurogenesis.
