"ERP013381"	"Mouse embryonic RNA-seq"	"The study was aimed at interrogating the early stages of blood cell development within the embryo. Blood develops from mesoderm, which is specified at gastrulation. We therefore sorted cells from mouse embryos between E6.5 and E7.75 to capture gastrulation and the emergence of mesoderm, followed by specificiation of the first mature blood cells."

"SRP094958"	"Genomic profiling of human spermatogonial stem cells [scRNA-Seq]"	"To better understand human spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), we profiled their transciptome and epigenome, which revealed the mechanism how human SSCs regulates their self-renewal versus differentiation dermination, as well as how latent pluripotency is established in human SSCs. Remarkly, we discovered signaling pathways (e.g. LIF, BMP, WNT) that differentially regulated self-renewal vesus differentiation in SSCs. We also discovered that SSCs repress core pluripotent factors (Sox2, Pou5f1 and Nanog) yet activate ancillary factors (e.g. Klf4, Mbd3, Tcf3, Sall4) transcriptionally and epigenetically. Overall design: Using SSEA4 as self-renewal marker and Kit as differentiating marker, we isolated self-renewal and differentiation SSCs by magnetic antibody cell sorting (MACS). SSEA4+ or Kit+ cells were loaded into 5-10 µm integrated fluidic circuits (IFCs) using Fluidigm C1 instrument. Single cells in IFCs were lysed and total RNA was harvested for polyadenylation selection, reverse transcription and PCR amplification. Library constructions were performed according to Fluidigm Library preparation with Nextera XT protocol and sequenced on a 50-cycle single end run."

"SRP020490"	"Single-cell RNA-Seq reveals dynamic, random monoallelic gene expression in mammalian cells"	"In the diploid genome, genes come in two copies, which can have different DNA sequence and where one is maternal and one is paternal. In a particular cell, a gene could potentially be expressed from both copies (biallelic expression) or only one (monoallelic). We performed RNA-Sequencing on individual cells, from zygote to the cells of the late blastocyst, and also individual cells from the adult liver. Using first generation crosses between two distantly related mouse strains, CAST/Ei and C57BL/6, we determined the expression separately from the maternal and paternal alleles. We found that half of the genes were expressed by only one allele, randomly so that some cells would express the paternal allele, some the maternal and a few cell both alleles. We also observed the spread of the progressive inactivation of the paternal X chromosome. Overall design: First generation mouse strain crosses were used to study monoallelic expression on the single cell level"	"SRA"	"partial"	"GSE45719, PRJNA195938 (10 libraries in scRNASeqLibrary_not_included.tsv, because cell culture)"	"scRNA-seq"	"307 libraries"	"Smart-seq"	"Full-length"
"SRP075496"	"Single cell transcriptome analysis of human pancreas reveals transcriptional signatures of aging and somatic mutation patterns"	"As organisms age, cells accumulate genetic and epigenetic changes that eventually lead to impaired organ function or catastrophic failure such as cancer. Here we describe a single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2544 human pancreas cells from donors, spanning six decades of life. We find that islet cells from older donors have increased levels of disorder as measured both by noise in the transcriptome and by the number of cells which display inappropriate hormone expression, revealing a transcriptional instability associated with aging. By analyzing the spectrum of somatic mutations in single cells from previously-healthy donors, we find a specific age-dependent mutational signature characterized by C to A and C to G transversions, indicators of oxidative stress, which is absent in single cells from human brain tissue or in a tumor cell line. Cells carrying a high load of such mutations also express higher levels of stress and senescence markers, including FOS, JUN, and the cytoplasmic superoxide dismutase SOD1, markers previously linked to pancreatic diseases with substantial age-dependent risk, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and adenocarcinoma. Thus, our single-cell approach unveils gene expression changes and somatic mutations acquired in aging human tissue, and identifies molecular pathways induced by these genetic changes that could influence human disease. Also, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using single-cell RNA-seq data from primary cells to derive meaningful insights into the genetic processes that operate on aging human tissue and to determine which molecular mechanisms are coordinated with these processes.

Individual cells were immediately transferred to lysate buffer and underwent reverse transcription and cDNA amplification (SMARTer Ultra Low RNA Kit for Sequencing, Clonetech). The amplified cDNA were sonicated to ~250 bp fragments by the Covaris S2 system and then subjected to end-repair, dA-tail, adaptor ligation, and 12 cycles of PCR amplification using the library preparation kit (NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit, NEB). The cDNA libraries were sequenced by Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. The sequenced raw data were first pre-processed to remove low-quality reads, adaptor sequences and amplification primer. Reads were mapped to Drosophila genome and mapped reads were selected for further analysis. FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase Of Exon Per Million Fragments Mapped) was used to quantify gene expression."

"SRP109266"	"Classifying Drosophila Olfactory Projection Neuron Subtypes by Single-cell RNA Sequencing"	"How a neuronal cell type is defined and how this relates to its transcriptome are still open questions. The Drosophila olfactory projection neurons (PNs) are among the bestcharacterized neuronal types: Different PN classes target dendrites to distinct olfactory glomeruli and PNs of the same class exhibit indistinguishable anatomical and physiological properties. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we comprehensively characterized the transcriptomes of 40 PN classes and unequivocally identified transcriptomes for 6 classes. We found a new lineage-specific transcription factor that instructs PN dendrite targeting. Transcriptomes of closely-related PN classes exhibit the largest difference during circuit assembly, but become indistinguishable in adults, suggesting that neuronal subtype diversity peaks during development. Genes encoding transcription factors and cell-surface molecules are the most differentially expressed, indicating their central roles in specifying neuronal identity. Finally, we show that PNs use highly redundant combinatorial molecular codes to distinguish subtypes, enabling robust specification of cell identity and circuit assembly.
