"SRP251970"	"A single-cell survey of Drosophila blood"	"Drosophila blood cells, called the hemocytes, are composed of three distinct cell populations: plasmatocytes (PM), crystal cells (CC), and lamellocytes (LM). These cell types have been extensively characterized based on the expression of a few marker genes and cell morphologies, which are inadequate to classify the complete hemocyte repertoire. Further, intermediate states along the course of maturation of these cell types have been poorly characterized. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map the Drosophila larval hemocytes across different inflammatory conditions. We identified all known cell types, resolved PMs into different states based on the expression of genes involved in cell cycle, antimicrobial response, and metabolism together with the detection of CC and LM intermediates. Further, we discovered rare cells within CC and LM populations that express the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) ligand branchless (bnl) and receptor breathless (btl), respectively. We demonstrate that both bnl and btl are required for mediating effective immune responses against parasitoid wasp eggs in vivo, highlighting a novel role for FGF signaling in inter-hemocyte crosstalk. Our scRNA-seq analysis reveals the diversity of hemocyte populations and provides a rich resource of gene expression profiles for a systems-level understanding of their functions.

"SRP162698"	"A cell atlas of the adult Drosophila midgut"	"Drosophila guts were dissociated to single cells as previously described (Dutta et al., 2015) with a few modifications. Guts were dissected from 7-day old adult esg-sfGFP/+, pros- Gal4>RFP/+ females. After pulling out the gut, the crop and midgut/hindgut junction (where the Malpighian tubules branch out of the gut) and Malpighian tubules were removed. Five flies at a time were dissected and immediately transferred into cold PBS containing 1% BSA to avoid exposing the midgut tissue to room temperature for a long period of time. Once 40 guts were dissected, they were transferred to a dissection plate and chopped into small pieces using a razor blade. These small fragments were immediately transferred to an eppendorf tube containing 400 ul of 1 mg/ml elastase/PBS solution (Sigma E0258) and incubated on a shaker at 27 ̊C for 30 min. 1% of BSA in PBS (final concentration) was used to stop the digestion reaction and prevent cells from aggregating. The cell suspension was passed through 100 um and then a 40 um cell strainer and loaded on the top of Optiprep with density gradient 1.12 g/ml. Viable cells were isolated from the top layer of the sample after centrifugation at 800xg for 20 min. Cell viability and number were assessed by 0.4% trypan blue and hemocytometer.

"SRP200614"	"Single-cell sequencing of enteroendocrine cells (EEs) in Drosophila midgut."	"Enteroendocrine cells (EEs) in the intestinal epithelium have important endocrine functions, yet this cell lineage exhibits great local and regional variations that have hampered detailed characterization of EE subtypes. Through single cell RNA-sequencing analysis, combined with a collection of neuropeptide/receptor knock-in strains, here we provide a comprehensive analysis of cellular diversity, spatial distribution and transcription factor (TF) code of EEs in adult Drosophila midgut. We identify 10 major EE subtypes that totally produced 14 different classes of hormone peptides. Each EE on average co-produces 2-5 different classes of hormone peptides. Functional screen with subtype-enriched TFs suggests a combinatorial TF code that controls EE cell diversity, with class-specific TFs Mirr and Ptx1that respectively define two major classes of EEs, and regional TFs such as Esg, Drm, Exex and Fer1that further define regional EE identity. Our single-cell data should greatly facilitate Drosophila modeling of EE differentiation and function. Overall design: FACS sort EE cells using CG32547-KI-GAL4> uas-GFP line and perform 10X genomics single cell sequencing. Raw data was further processed by Seurat algorithm and EE subtypes were visualized by generating a t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) plot."
