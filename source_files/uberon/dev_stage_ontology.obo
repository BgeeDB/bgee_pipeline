comment: Temporal ordering number - 257. Not to be confused with mitotic domain 14B, which is a domain of cells in the dorsal midline of the head that don't undergo a 14th division (Foe, 1989). The asynchronous nature of cycle 14 divisions means that this is not very useful for annotating stage. If possible a standard embryonic stage should be used instead.

def: "Chicken developmental stage that covers the period from hatching until 4 weeks old, during which individuals have no feathers." [Bgee:curator]
comment: For now, in Bgee, dev. stages can have only one direct parent by part_of relation. In Uberon, UBERON:0007221 neonate stage is both part_of UBERON:0018685 nursing stage, in mammalia, and of UBERON:0000112 sexually immature stage in other species. To accomodate Bgee, for now we merge GgalDv:0000004 hwith UBERON:0007221 neonate, as it should. This should be reverted when Bgee updates, by adding a xref to UBERON:0007221

def: "Nematode larval development begins with the newly hatched first-stage larva (L1) and ends with the end of the last larval stage (for example the fourth larval stage (L4) in C. elegans). Each stage of nematode larval development is characterized by proliferation of specific cell lineages and an increase in body size without alteration of the basic body plan. Nematode larval stages are separated by molts in which each stage-specific exoskeleton, or cuticle, is shed and replaced anew." [GO:0002119]

Cell  fates,  including  cell divisions and expression of cell fate markers, are equivalent between L3 and PDL3 stages (Liu and Ambros, 1991; Euling  and  Ambros,  1996;  Braendle  and  Félix,  2008;  Karp  and  Greenwald,  2013).  However,  no  molt  occurs between dauer and PDL3. Thus, dauer alae are still visible on the cuticle, although more difficult to see because they become stretched as the larva loses radial constriction and begins to grow (Cassada and Russell, 1975; Riddle et al.,1997).\"" xsd:string {xref="PMID:27417559"}

PDL4 larvae are morphologically indistinguishable from L4 larvae, at least at the gross level. Similarly, PDadults appear identical to adults that developed continuously. However, subtle differences do exist. For example,some changes in muscle arm and neuronal cell structure persist in post-dauer stages (Dixon et al., 2008; Schroeder et al., 2013). Interestingly, this apparent similarity between post-dauer and continuously developed animals belies a number of changes at the level of expression of protein coding and small RNA coding genes, as well as changes in chromatin structure (Hall et al., 2010; Karp et al., 2011; Hall et al., 2013).\"" xsd:string {xref="PMID:27417559"}

comment: this relation lacks a strong logical interpretation, but can be used in place of never_in_taxon where it is desirable to state that the definition of the class is too strict for the taxon under consideration, but placing a never_in_taxon link would result in a chain of inconsistencies that will take time to resolve.

property_value: editor_note "An example is: translation preceded_by transcription; aging preceded_by development (not however death preceded_by aging). Where derives_from links classes of continuants, preceded_by links classes of processes. Clearly, however, these two relations are not independent of each other. Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

In most subsequent forms, many of these early ribs have been lost, and in living amphibians and reptiles, there is great variation in rib structure and number. For example, turtles have only eight pairs of ribs, which are developed into a bony or cartilagenous carapace and plastron, while snakes have numerous ribs running along the full length of their trunk. Frogs typically have no ribs, aside from a sacral pair, which form part of the pelvis. Mammals usually also only have distinct ribs on the thoracic vertebra, although fixed cervical ribs are also present in monotremes. In marsupials and placental mammals, the cervical and lumbar ribs are found only as tiny remnants fused to the vertebrae, where they are referred to as transverse processes. In general, the structure and number of the true ribs in humans is similar to that in other mammals. Unlike reptiles, caudal ribs are never found in mammals." xsd:string
